# Build cycles and usability log

This is the standing record for Andrew and Codex. Each cycle leaves a working build, records verification and known gaps, and gives Andrew a small optional usability exercise. Feedback steers the next cycle; routine implementation does not require a check-in.

## Cycle history

| Cycle | Scope | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | macOS foundation | Complete | Native menus/dialogs, UTF-8 saving; 13 tests |

| 5 | UI alignment and Markdown preview consistency | Complete | 20 tests; comparison screenshots |

Earlier execution detail, including the overnight computer-use stall, is in [overnight-progress.md](overnight-progress.md). Detailed reference capabilities are in [ia-writer-inventory.md](ia-writer-inventory.md).

## Cycle 4 — organizer and file navigation

**Intent:** match the useful structure of iA's organizer + file list + editor + preview.

**Implemented:** persisted local locations; file/folder favorites; 20 deduplicated recent files; removable shortcuts; name/modified/created/extension sorting; ascending/descending; folder pinning; independent organizer visibility. Organizer collapses below 1,000 px. Document switching still uses the unsaved-change prompt. Removing a shortcut does not delete files.

**Verification:** 19-test cycle-4 suite passed; organizer and recent entries inspected in the running Cycle 5 app. Final visual polish and packaging included in Cycle 5.

**Known gaps:** filter searches expanded folders only; no smart folders, hashtags, excerpts, list navigation or drag/drop organization. Locations are plain local paths, not special iCloud APIs. Settings are stored per app/user; multiple already-open processes do not live-sync their organizer state.

**Andrew's optional five-minute test:**

1. Open the packaged app and choose a small writing folder with a subfolder.
2. Add a second location. Switch between them and try sorting by name/date.
3. Favorite a folder and a saved document; open them from Favorites.
4. Edit a disposable note, then select a recent file. Check Save/Discard/Cancel feels clear.
5. Hide Organizer, switch Editor/Split/Preview, and resize the window.

**Feedback:** What felt awkward? Which navigation action did you expect but could not find? Were the pane widths, labels and click targets comfortable? Record examples below or tell Codex in this task.

## Upcoming cycles

**Superseded on 17 September 2026:** use the [staged development plan](development-plan.md) for proposed Cycles 14–28 and the [screenshot parity log](ia-menu-parity-2026-09-17.md) for acceptance scope. The table below is historical planning, not the current schedule.

| Cycle | Planned features | Acceptance focus |
|---|---|---|
| Next navigation cycle | Quick open, back/forward, tree/list, date/excerpt options; bounded recursive search | Deferred in favor of Andrew’s requested UI tuning |
| Later navigation cycle | Hashtags and smart folders | Accurate indexing; ordinary Markdown stays portable |
| 7 | Preview sync, anchors, output templates, HTML/PDF export | Source/output consistency; local images; pagination |
| 8 | Expanded Format menu and editing toolbar | One-step undo; selection/cursor stability; Markdown round trip |
| 9 | Sentence focus, spelling and writing aids | Useful behavior without false linguistic/provenance claims |
| 10 | Native multi-document lifecycle, autosave/version strategy, accessibility | Recovery and data safety; keyboard-only use |
| Later | Authorship, publishing, custom commands/integrations | Define actual personal workflow before implementation |

## Cycle 5 — UI alignment and preview consistency

**Andrew's direction:** prioritize the UI before more features; verify the preview around `#title`; keep screenshots and usability records in the project.

**Implemented:** compact shared chrome controls, segmented Editor/Split/Preview choices, narrower organizer/file panes, subtle separators, bottom file filter, smaller file rows, quiet section labels, bottom editor actions and visible status feedback. macOS dialogs inherit the system-style interface face. Preview typography uses a smaller body size and controlled heading scale. Source highlighting now keeps fenced code literal and recognizes up to three leading spaces before headings.

**Preview result:** iA confirms `# title` is a heading and `#title` is a hashtag rather than a heading. Omawrite follows the same heading rule; hashtag linking remains unimplemented. No automatic source rewriting was introduced.

**Checks:** 20 tests pass, including real QML preview document heading levels, source preservation and literal fenced code. Visual review caught and corrected clipped control labels and a preview font-base mismatch. Known Qt Material teardown warnings remain in the native-dialog test; no new runtime failure was observed.

**Usability exercise and screenshots:** [research/cycle-05](../research/cycle-05/README.md), [Andrew's checklist](../research/usability/cycle-05.md).

**Deferred:** exact iA template rendering, synced scroll, excerpt rows, full icon/accessibility polish, sentence focus and broader Markdown extensions. This is closer visual alignment, not a parity claim. Preview/Editor still scroll independently.

**Cycle 5 final result:** build/package and deep/strict signature verification passed. Native checks confirmed organizer visibility, heading rendering, live heading updates, and Preview/Split switching. The sample was restored and saved; existing unsaved user windows were not touched. Four final/reference screenshots plus an intermediate screenshot and test/package logs are retained under `research/cycle-05/`. Runnable artifact: `dist/Omawrite.app`; review fixture: `examples/Preview-check.md`. For a fresh process when an older Omawrite is already open, run `./dist/Omawrite.app/Contents/MacOS/Omawrite examples/Preview-check.md` from this project folder.


## Cycle 6 — navy palette and line icons

**Planned scope / feedback:** Andrew found teal unpleasant and preferred iA Writer's icon treatment. Prioritize color and control clarity before expanding features.

**Implemented:** navy active controls, pale blue selected rows, consistent blue focus/selection accents; original line icons replace symbol-font glyphs in the toolbar and library. Editor/Split/Preview retain labels and accessible names. macOS document accent defaults changed separately from Linux.

**Checks:** build succeeds; all 20 existing regression tests pass. No document-format or I/O behavior was changed. Native verification and screenshots are recorded in [cycle 6 research](../research/cycle-06/README.md).

**Known gaps:** full dark-appearance and keyboard accessibility audit remains outstanding; synced preview and advanced navigation remain deferred. This pass does not claim iA feature parity.

**Runnable artifact:** `dist/Omawrite.app`. [Optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-06.md): try layout icons, select files/text, and judge blue contrast and icon clarity.

**Native result:** sample opened, navy/icon rendering reviewed, Preview/Split switching verified, screenshots saved. Package and deep/strict signature check passed. Runtime log empty; sample unchanged. Dark appearance not manually verified.

## Cycle 7 — UI matching

Andrew said the open apps still looked very different and requested direct comparison and iteration. Planned scope: pane proportions, smaller type, shared title/toolbar space, quieter navigation rows and footer controls. Two layout revisions are in the working tree; the first passed 20 tests after corrections, but native review exposed title/content overlap. A second correction builds and has an empty runtime log; visual and regression checks remain pending. Cycle 6 remains the packaged/committed checkpoint. See [resume notes and current evidence](../research/cycle-07/README.md). Paused at Andrew's request before he sleeps the computer; no background work scheduled. Optional usability exercise after verification: compare both apps on Preview-check.md, assess text scale, pane balance and toolbar placement.

**Cycle 7 final result (11 September):** resumed and completed with corrected macOS title/toolbar placement, smaller typography, balanced panes, file dates/snippets, footer controls and persistent status. Build, 22 tests, package and deep/strict signature check passed. Native review verified key layout controls and final screenshot; no sample changes. Runnable artifact: `dist/Omawrite.app`. [Evidence and remaining gaps](../research/cycle-07/README.md), [optional comparison exercise](../research/usability/cycle-07.md). Preview template details and full native-window/dark/narrow-width audits remain outstanding.

## Workflow follow-up — approval visibility and reusable QA app

Andrew identified repeated app-access approvals as the cause of long attachment waits. Changed macOS ChatGPT notification style to Persistent (notifications and sounds were already enabled). Added `bin/prepare-dev-app` with one stable QA path/ID and a running-process guard; no global security policies changed. Preparation, shell syntax and strict signature verification passed. Closed two inspected clean QA windows; preserved recovered unsaved content. In-app permission/question alerts and the one-app Always allow selection require Andrew's own interaction; Computer Use cannot operate Codex itself. [Details and procedure](development-app-approvals.md).

## Cycle 8 — rounded Sort by menu

**Planned scope:** Andrew asked for rounded controls and a compact dropdown matching the sorting menu in his iA screenshot.

**Implemented:** rounded Sort by pill, separate compact menu, four sort fields, exclusive A to Z/Z to A choices, folder pinning, persistent date/excerpt visibility toggles, checkmarks and standard interface typography. The folder-actions menu shares the style. Navigation and date-format submenus remain deferred.

**Verification:** build and 23 tests passed, including menu action coverage. Native menu inspected and captured in the stable development app; saved sample closed normally before refreshing it. Dark appearance/full keyboard audit untested. [Records](../research/cycle-08/README.md), [optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-08.md). Runnable artifacts: `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and packaged `dist/Omawrite.app`. Final packaging and strict signature verification passed.

## Cycle 9 — quieter file browsing

**Planned scope / feedback:** Andrew requested delayed filename tooltips and compact file rows, with a top-level excerpt toggle.

**Implemented:** 700ms hover delay for file rows and shared chrome controls (including organizer paths); a rounded Previews toggle beside Sort by, synchronized with Show Text Excerpts. Compact filename-and-icon rows retain extensions. Dates and excerpts start hidden through a one-time preference migration; subsequent choices persist. Hidden excerpts are not fetched. Document preview is unaffected.

**Checks:** build succeeded; all 23 tests passed with normal macOS access, including button/menu synchronization. The initial restricted run failed the existing file-watcher check; the native rerun passed. Native QA verified the migrated compact default and toggling excerpts on/off with sample files. Screenshots saved in [cycle 9 records](../research/cycle-09/README.md). Exact hover timing and dark appearance remain manual checks.

**Runnable artifacts:** `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` (stable QA identity) and `dist/Omawrite.app`. See [optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-09.md). No source documents changed.

Final packaging and deep/strict signature verification passed.

## Cycle 10 — library options menu

**Scope:** add the actions visible in Andrew's reference screenshot to the library toolbar dropdown.

**Implemented:** New File, New Folder, Sort By and View Options submenus, Hide/Show Sort Bar and Hide/Show Filter Bar. Original line icons, submenu chevrons and compact rounded styling. Bar visibility persists. Sort By shares its implementation with the existing sort dropdown; View Options controls dates and text excerpts. Choose Folder and Refresh remain below a separator. Hiding the filter bar preserves its active filter text.

**Verification:** build and 24 tests passed, including bar-action labels and submenu sorting. Native QA verified opening both submenus and hiding/restoring both bars. Sample document unchanged. Screenshots and logs in research/cycle-10/. New File/New Folder use the existing dialogs and I/O; creating new items via these new menu entries and full keyboard/dark-mode behavior remain untested in native QA. No claim of full iA View Options parity.

**Artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app. Optional exercise: open the dropdown beside +, try the two submenus, hide and restore each bar, and confirm your preferred settings survive restart.

Cycle 10 final check: New File and New Folder dialogs opened and cancelled successfully in native QA. Final packaging and deep/strict signature verification passed.

## Cycle 11 — blue icons and larger Mac interface text

**Feedback / planned scope:** Andrew requested iA-like filled blue folders, blue outline location markers, white document icons, larger header labels, system-style interface typography, and rounder window corners.

**Implemented:** original vector drawings for shaded blue folders and folded white pages in the file list; blue outline folders for organizer locations/favorites; filled folder in the header. Native macOS general system font replaces Helvetica Neue in interface chrome and menus; source writing font remains unchanged. Header folder/document labels grow from 12 to 15px with stronger weight; file labels and standard buttons use 13px. No new settings.

**Verification:** build and 24 regression tests passed after correcting an icon-color fallback found in native QA. Native inspection confirmed location outline colors, filled folders, document icons, restored toolbar icons and larger header labels. Saved screenshots/icons-and-header.png uses the project library and sample document; private recents hidden. Sample contents unchanged.

**Limits:** outer window corners and traffic-light controls remain native and unchanged; no custom frame or claimed exact iA corner matching. Icons are original approximations, not extracted iA assets. Full dark-mode, narrow-window and display-scaling checks remain outstanding.

**Artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app. Optional usability exercise: compare folder/document legibility, header text size and location blue, and try a narrower window. Report whether the white document icons need stronger contrast.

Cycle 11 final packaging and deep/strict signature verification passed.

## Cycle 12 — collapsible organizer sections and native title bar

**Planned scope:** Favorites/Recents disclosure chevrons, aligned favorite actions, and investigation of the larger/lower native traffic lights and rounder frame in Andrew's iA reference.

**Implemented:** clickable section headers with down/right chevrons and persisted expanded states. Favorites collapses its entries and add actions; Recents collapses its entries without clearing them. Favorite folder/document use identical left padding and plus-icon columns. macOS now requests a native unified NSToolbar/title-bar style rather than a plain title bar; native controls retain their system behavior and dimensions.

**Verification:** build and 25 tests passed, including disclosure toggles and shortcut preservation. Native QA verified both collapses and Favorites restoration, aligned actions, and continued toolbar interaction. Screenshots under research/cycle-12/screenshots show the sample document and hide private recents. The screen-sharing badge overlays the traffic lights, so exact dot size/placement and corner-radius parity with iA remain unverified. No custom corner mask or enlarged imitation controls added. Full dark-mode, restart persistence and fullscreen transition checks remain outstanding.

**Artifacts:** dist/Omawrite.app and dist/Omawrite Dev.app. The running Dev bundle has the same functional implementation as the final source (subsequent changes only reindent QML/add tests). The sample acquired unsaved state during QA; no save/discard action was taken and that window was preserved.

**Optional exercise:** toggle both section headers, check aligned Favorite actions, restart after saving your work to check persistence, and compare the traffic lights and corners once app inspection stops.

Native API reference: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/toolbarstyle-swift.enum/unified

Cycle 12 final packaging and deep/strict signature verification passed.

## Cycle 13 — Codex becomes the interface reference

**Direction:** Andrew replaces iA as the visual reference with his Codex screenshot. Focus on monochrome folder icons, calmer selection, typography and positioning.

**Implemented:** original gray outline folder drawing with a detached top edge and tapered body, used throughout library/header/organizer; document rows use outline page icons. Neutral rounded selection replaces blue navigation highlights; file dividers/selection stripe removed. Navigation text 14px, regular-weight folder/document headers; document title aligned left. Sidebar surface and spacing softened. Focus rings appear for keyboard navigation rather than every mouse click. Existing native unified window controls retained; their exact dimensions/corners were not customized.

**Checks:** build and 25 tests passed. Native inspection of the updated build is pending because the existing Dev window has unsaved changes. User asked whether those may be saved before refreshing. No sample or private writing has been overwritten. No new screenshot is claimed until that check completes. The user reference screenshot contains private material and is not copied into the repository.

**Artifacts:** packaged dist/Omawrite.app; running dist/Omawrite Dev.app still contains the previous cycle pending safe refresh. Full dark/narrow-window audit remains outstanding.

**Usability:** compare the outline folders, neutral selections and header placement with Codex; check sidebar labels at normal window size.

Cycle 13 packaging and deep/strict signature verification passed. Native visual verification and Dev refresh remain pending the unsaved-document decision.

## Menu audit planning pass — 12 September

Andrew requested screenshots and separate menu inventories for iA Writer, Typora and Omawrite Dev, then an incremental comparison/selection table. Created docs/menu-comparison.md and research/menu-audit-2026-09-12/ with per-app inventory records and capture checklist. Verified iA File today and Omawrite menus against source; remaining iA details are from the previous native audit. Typora commands and all fresh screenshots remain pending app-access approval: automatic review blocked potential incidental exposure of private document/sidebar content. No product code changes or build/test run needed. Suggested first implementation pass: View, using existing functionality. Raw capture folder is ignored by Git. This audit is not complete.

## Screenshot parity planning pass — 17 September 2026

**Requested scope:** inspect Andrew’s new iA menu screenshots, log existing/partial/missing behavior and stage development toward functional parity.

**Completed:** viewed all seven images in screenshots/ (File, Edit, Format, View, Focus, Go and Window); compared current QML/C++ menus and supporting behavior; created [command-level log](ia-menu-parity-2026-09-17.md) and [staged plan](development-plan.md). Updated inventory for confirmed Go commands and already-implemented bar visibility. Prior working-tree changes preserved.

**Verification:** documentation/source review only; no editor changes, build/test run, app attachment or new runnable artifact. Last recorded Cycle 13 build/25 tests/package success remains historical. Native Cycle 13 closeout is still pending.

**Known gaps:** nested reference menus, export choices, and app/Authors/Help screenshots absent from this batch. Supplied images include private surrounding content and have not been staged or copied into research. Full parity remains a multi-stage target, including advanced language/provenance and native lifecycle behavior.

**Next runnable increment:** Cycle 13 QA closeout, then Cycle 14 shared native View/Focus/formatting actions. Existing artifacts remain dist/Omawrite.app and dist/Omawrite Dev.app; no refresh claimed.

**Optional exercise:** read the File and Go tables, then identify the three missing commands most useful in daily work; use that feedback to reorder later increments. No feedback is required to understand or use the proposed sequence.

## Cycle 14 — shared native workspace menus

**Planned scope:** expose existing View/Focus/inline-format functionality through native menus with shared state; preserve document behavior.

**Implemented:** shared command registry and native menu adapter; pane/bar visibility, sorting, dates/excerpts, text size, source markup, preview/layout/typeface/reload, outline/statistics/fullscreen; Focus paragraph/typewriter; Format strike/inline code. No new shortcuts or nonfunctional reference-menu placeholders. Organizer is unavailable when hidden by library/narrow-window constraints.

**Correction found by tests:** selected-text wrapping previously required multiple undo steps. C++ QTextCursor edit blocks now make bold/italic/strike/code wrapping a single undo operation, retaining the inner selection.

**Checks:** build passed; 28 automated tests passed with normal macOS access. The first restricted run failed the pre-existing file-watcher test; the normal-access run passed. Tests cover shared menu states, size bounds, source/undo preservation, preview parsing and formatting undo/redo. Existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain.

**Native verification:** pending. App attachment returned no-window/timeout errors; process check found the old Dev app running. Preparation guard refused replacement, preserving possible unsaved work. Andrew has been asked to save/quit normally. No new screenshot or Cycle 13 visual closeout is claimed. Dark-mode, keyboard, restart-persistence, local-image reload and fullscreen native checks remain.

**Evidence/artifacts:** [cycle records](../research/cycle-14/README.md), [usability checklist](../research/usability/cycle-14.md); packaged dist/Omawrite.app is the new build, stable dist/Omawrite Dev.app remains old pending safe refresh. Changes are uncommitted.

**Optional exercise:** configure the workspace through View, toggle Focus, format a sample word and undo once. Native QA closeout comes before Cycle 15.

## Cycle 15 — everyday file access (17–18 September 2026)

**Planned scope:** File New variants, New Folder, recents, Finder/library reveal and Go locations; preserve UTF-8 storage, unsaved prompts and recovery.

**Implemented:** New in current window; existing New Window retained; new library file in current/new window; New Folder; shared File/Go recents; dynamic locations and Add Location; Finder and explicit library reveal. File creation waits for the unsaved decision. Failed open/create preserves the current buffer/recovery. Removed duplicate Full Screen item after native inspection identified AppKit’s automatic entry.

**Checks:** build and 31 automated tests passed; stable Dev bundle prepared/signature verified. Final package/signature logs are in [Cycle 15 records](../research/cycle-15/README.md). No shortcuts reassigned.

**Native results:** old clean QA window closed safely; Cycle 14 View menu inspected. Cycle 15 recents opening, location switching, library file creation, unsaved New/Cancel, sample Save and filtered-file reveal verified. Native sample is examples/Cycle15-QA.md. Screenshot capture unavailable. Finder inspection stalled overnight and returned Desktop; Finder selection remains unverified. Native picker attempt was inconclusive (Open disabled), cancelled; recents opening worked.

**Gaps:** native new-window creation, folder creation, Add Location, picker reproduction, Finder selection, dark/narrow/keyboard and remaining Cycle 14 checks. Source and tests do not establish full iA parity. No private screenshots saved.

**Runnable artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app refreshed to Cycle 15; dist/Omawrite.app packaged separately. Changes uncommitted. [Optional exercise/checklist](../research/usability/cycle-15.md): create/reopen/reveal a sample and cancel unsaved New. Next feature stage: Cycle 16 duplicate/rename/move, with the remaining native checks tracked explicitly.

## Cycle 15b — blue folder accents (18 September 2026)

**Planned scope / feedback:** Andrew likes the current outline shapes and asks for blue folder icons, retaining gray document icons. Apply the distinction to Locations, folder favorites, library rows and the folder header. Keep neutral selection backgrounds and existing text colors. This is a small polish pass before resuming Cycle 16’s duplicate/rename/move work.

**Verification plan:** build and existing regression suite; refresh the stable Dev app only after normal close; visually inspect sample folders/documents, record screenshots if capture is available. No new behavior tests needed for this color-only change.

**Cycle 15b result:** blue outlines applied to folder buttons and library folders; document icons stay gray. Build and 31 tests passed. Closed the clean Dev sample normally, refreshed the stable bundle, reopened Workspace-tour.md and verified light-mode folder/document distinction, header and selected-location appearance. [Screenshot and records](../research/cycle-15b/README.md), [optional review](../research/usability/cycle-15b.md). Private recents collapsed; no source document edited. Dark-mode and folder-favorite appearance remain unverified natively. Packaged artifact/signature logs saved under research/cycle-15b/logs/. Both app bundles contain this polish pass. Next scope remains Cycle 16a duplicate/rename, followed by 16b move.

## Cycle 16a — Duplicate and Rename (20 September 2026)

**Planned scope:** add sibling-file Duplicate and Rename to File. Duplicate copies the current editor text (including unsaved edits) without switching or saving the original. Rename changes the saved file’s name in its current folder, retaining the open buffer and undo; update recents/favorites, watcher and recovery. Reject collisions, path separators, unavailable files and external disk changes. Preserve Save As and existing shortcuts. Move To remains Cycle 16b.

**Acceptance:** filesystem/content/dirty-state/undo tests; native sample-only dialog, collision, cancel and successful operations; stable QA bundle refresh and package/signature checks.


**Implemented:** File Duplicate… and Rename… with a shared name dialog and inline errors. Duplicate writes the current UTF-8 buffer to a new sibling, leaving the original active and dirty state unchanged. Rename preserves text/undo and updates the active path, watcher, recovery snapshot, favorites and recents. Existing names, invalid names, symlinks and unavailable sources are refused; Rename additionally refuses detected disk changes. Save As remains unchanged.

**Checks:** build passed; 32 automated tests passed with normal macOS access, including Unicode content/names, no-overwrite behavior, invalid paths, dirty buffer preservation, undo/redo, organizer paths, recovery snapshot contents/new URL, save to the renamed path and external-change detection after rename. Existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Stable Dev preparation and packaged app signature verification passed.

**Native verification:** sample Duplicate collision and success (original stays active), opening copy through Recents, Rename collision and Cancel, successful dirty rename, undo/redo and Save all passed. Sample-only [collision screenshot](../research/cycle-16a/screenshots/rename-collision.png) visually inspected. Left Dev open on the clean examples/Cycle16-QA-renamed.md sample; prior user document was closed normally without edits.

**Known gaps:** case-only renames on case-insensitive volumes are refused; source symlinks and unsaved untitled documents require saving to a regular file first. Disk-full/permission fault injection, recovery relaunch, concurrent writers in the rename interval, dark/narrow dialog checks and cross-window path coordination are not verified. Move To remains 16b; earlier native QA gaps remain tracked. This is implemented local Duplicate/Rename behavior, not a claim of complete iA parity.

**Artifacts / exercise:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-16a/README.md), [optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-16a.md). Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier cycles. Next: 16b Move To, then 17 search/edit menus. Current plan has 22 listed increments remaining across the unfinished Cycle 16 and Cycles 17–28, plus outstanding QA closeout.


## Cycle 16b — Move To (20 September 2026)

**Planned scope:** File → Move To… chooses an existing local destination folder, keeps the filename and unsaved buffer/undo, and updates path, recents/favorites, watcher and recovery. Refuse collisions, unavailable/symlink sources and disk changes. Copy saved bytes exclusively, verify destination and recheck source before removing original; failure keeps the original active and reports any retained copy. Relative document links resolve from the new folder. Native cancel/success and automated safety checks, build/test, stable QA refresh and packaging required.


**Implemented:** native File → Move To… with a Qt folder picker on macOS. Keeps the filename and unsaved buffer/undo; moves saved disk contents using an exclusive copy, reads back the copy and rechecks the source before deleting the original. Collision, symlink source and unavailable/external-change errors preserve the active document. Failed source removal leaves both files and reports this explicitly. Success updates active URL/base URL, watcher, recovery and recents/favorites. Relative links resolve from the new folder; linked assets are not moved.

**Checks:** build passed; final 33-test suite passed, including QML picker open/accept, Unicode, same-folder no-op, missing/nonlocal destination, existing file and dangling-link collisions, read-only source-directory removal failure, dirty buffer/undo/redo/save, recovery URL/text, favorites/recents and external-change watching at the new path. An initial synthetic picker test attempted selection before opening it; corrected to open the dialog before choosing a destination. Existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Stable Dev preparation and package/signature checks passed.

**Live app verification:** user granted inspection after an automatic-review block; clean prior sample closed normally and stable Dev refreshed. Native file/folder pickers kept Open disabled, reproducing the earlier picker issue. Move To now uses Qt's built-in picker on macOS; destination navigation/selection and collision error passed. Cancel preserved the source. [Sample-only screenshot](../research/cycle-16b/screenshots/move-collision.png) visually inspected. QA stopped when the user switched Dev to their own document; no private screenshot saved and no further app actions taken.

**Remaining:** successful live-app move/recents reopen, separate-volume device test, disk-full/disconnection, crash/recovery relaunch, dark/narrow/keyboard audit, concurrent-writer race between verification and deletion, and cross-window coordination. Extended file metadata/ACL preservation is not promised beyond QFile copy behavior. The native Open picker issue remains outside this increment; Move To's Qt fallback is usable. Core move semantics and picker integration pass automated tests, but live success is still pending.

**Artifacts / next:** both dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed; [records](../research/cycle-16b/README.md), [optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-16b.md). Changes remain uncommitted with previous cycles. Next feature stage: Cycle 17 search/edit menus, with Move To live QA closeout first. The plan has 21 later feature increments across Cycles 17–28 plus outstanding verification.


## Cycle 16c — delayed path tooltips (20 September 2026)

**Feedback / scope:** Andrew reports the full-path tooltip appears immediately and wants approximately two seconds of hover.

**Changed:** Locations, Favorites and Recents now use ChromeButton's shared hint/visibility/delay instead of defining attached tooltips in each delegate. Added configurable tooltipDelay; path rows explicitly use 2000ms. Library path tooltips also use 2000ms. Ordinary toolbar hints retain 700ms, and accessible sidebar names remain the short file/folder labels.

**Checks:** build and all 33 existing tests passed; diff whitespace check passed. No new tests for this small timing change. Native timing verification and Dev refresh pending access: automatic review rejected app inspection due to possible private content; renewed approval requested despite earlier approval. Existing Dev bundle is preserved until normal close. Ordinary dist/Omawrite.app packaged and signature verified; Dev remains Cycle 16b pending access/normal close. Details: research/cycle-16c/README.md.

**Optional exercise:** hover a Recent item for less than two seconds, then hold still for two seconds; full path should appear only after the delay. Repeat for Locations/Favorites/library and move away to dismiss. This polish pass does not advance parity scope; Cycle 17 remains the next feature build after pending QA.


## Cycle 17 — search/edit menus (21 September 2026)

**Planned scope:** native Find submenu, Find/Replace/Next/Previous/selection search, Delete and editing enabled states. Shared search entry points reveal the editor from preview-only mode. C++ case-insensitive literal matching preserves original UTF-16 offsets; replacement uses a single undo block. Verify wrapping, empty/no-match queries, Unicode and replacement undo. Carry forward Cycle 16 native checks without claiming closure.


**Implemented:** native Edit → Find submenu with Find, Find and Replace, Next, Previous and Use Selection for Find; shared toolbar/shortcut entry points; Shift-Command-G for previous. Delete and editing enabled states respect the focused text field and read-only content. C++ literal case-insensitive matching uses original string offsets; single and all replacement run in one QTextCursor undo block. Empty/no-match replacement is disabled.

**Verification:** build and 34 tests passed, including Unicode offsets after İ/emoji, search wrapping, no-match states, Replace All one-step undo, single deletion replacement, selection search and Delete targeting the query field. Stable Dev refreshed after authorized inspection and normal close of the clean user document. Both app bundles packaged/refreshed; ordinary package signature verified. Native sample verified Find/Replace menu, enabled states, three replacements, one-step document undo, and previous/next wrapping (3/3 then 1/3). Sample-only screenshot visually inspected. Agent-created text discarded through the unsaved prompt; Dev left clean/untitled.

**Limits:** literal case-insensitive search only; no regex, whole-word or normalization equivalence. Full keyboard/accessibility/dark/narrow checks, hidden iA submenu options, clipboard variants and earlier Move To/separate-volume checks remain pending. Cycle 16c tooltip fix is now installed in Dev; exact live hover timing remains unverified. Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier cycles.

**Artifacts / exercise:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app; research/cycle-17/README.md and research/usability/cycle-17.md. Next: Cycle 18a block formatting. 20 listed feature increments remain across Cycles 18–28, plus outstanding QA.


**Final visual correction:** screenshot review showed the search panel covering the first source line. The editor now reserves vertical space beneath Find/Replace. Rebuilt, all 34 tests passed again, and the refreshed native sample screenshot confirms source matches remain visible. Final screenshot uses `cat CAT cat`; only agent-created test text was discarded afterward.


## Five-increment run — 18a through 20a (21 September 2026)

Andrew authorized the next five listed builds: 18a block formatting; 18b inline/structural insertion; 19a date/table/case/clear styles; 19b rich clipboard; 20a document/library history, enclosing folder, source links and recursive filename quick-open. Each stage will build/test independently; final stable bundles include all five. Unknown reference submenu details remain unverified rather than invented parity claims. Native QA will use disposable text and preserve the user's current writing.


## Cycle 18a — block formatting (21 September 2026)

**Planned scope / changes:** Heading/body, bullet/number/task lists, task toggling, blockquote, indent/outdent and line moves. C++ transformations preserve multiline selection and use one undo block.

**Checks:** ./bin/build and ./bin/test passed at this increment (35 tests). Final combined build revalidated all 39 tests; existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Native checks below used the final combined build, not five separately installed bundles.

**Native verification:** Native Format → Headings converted the current sample line to heading 2.

**Known gaps:** Nested Markdown containers and quoted/indented fence variants are not a complete Markdown parser; exhaustive native list/line-move checks remain.

**Runnable artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app (stable io.github.andrewjngray.omawrite.dev) and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed after normal QA-app close; ordinary package signature verification passed. Logs: research/cycle-18a/logs/. Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier work.

**Optional exercise:** Select two sample lines, apply Numbered List, then undo once.


## Cycle 18b — inline and structural insertion (21 September 2026)

**Planned scope / changes:** Toggle bold/italic/strike/inline code; backtick-safe delimiters, atomic link insertion, fenced code block and horizontal rule insertion.

**Checks:** ./bin/build and ./bin/test passed at this increment (36 tests). Final combined build revalidated all 39 tests; existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Native checks below used the final combined build, not five separately installed bundles.

**Native verification:** Command-B applied and removed bold on the selected heading text, retaining the inner selection.

**Known gaps:** Exact iA delimiter semantics and exhaustive escaped/nested markup combinations remain unverified.

**Runnable artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app (stable io.github.andrewjngray.omawrite.dev) and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed after normal QA-app close; ordinary package signature verification passed. Logs: research/cycle-18b/logs/. Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier work.

**Optional exercise:** Select a word, press Command-B twice, then try Code Block and undo.


## Cycle 19a — small editing tools (21 September 2026)

**Planned scope / changes:** ISO date, basic two-column table, Unicode case conversion and Clear Surrounding Inline Styles. Protected code/link-looking selections are refused for case/clear operations.

**Checks:** ./bin/build and ./bin/test passed at this increment (37 tests). Final combined build revalidated all 39 tests; existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Native checks below used the final combined build, not five separately installed bundles.

**Native verification:** Native Change Case → UPPERCASE converted the selected sample heading text.

**Known gaps:** Clear Styles is limited to surrounding inline markers; case conversion is not language-specific title casing. Native date/table coverage remains pending.

**Runnable artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app (stable io.github.andrewjngray.omawrite.dev) and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed after normal QA-app close; ordinary package signature verification passed. Logs: research/cycle-19a/logs/. Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier work.

**Optional exercise:** Select a word and change its case; insert a table on a blank line and undo.


## Cycle 19b — rich clipboard (21 September 2026)

**Planned scope / changes:** Copy As Markdown, HTML source or Formatted Text; Paste As Plain Text or Markdown from HTML. Clipboard conversions use Qt Markdown/HTML and atomic replacement.

**Checks:** ./bin/build and ./bin/test passed at this increment (38 tests). Final combined build revalidated all 39 tests; existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Native checks below used the final combined build, not five separately installed bundles.

**Native verification:** Formatted Text copy → Markdown from HTML paste preserved sample heading structure; one undo restored exact source. Sample screenshot visually inspected.

**Known gaps:** Cross-application paste interoperability remains untested; Qt conversion normalizes Markdown and is not lossless for every extension. Authorship paste is future work.

**Runnable artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app (stable io.github.andrewjngray.omawrite.dev) and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed after normal QA-app close; ordinary package signature verification passed. Logs: research/cycle-19b/logs/. Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier work.

**Optional exercise:** Copy a sample heading as formatted text, paste as Markdown, then undo once.


## Cycle 20a — navigation and quick-open (21 September 2026)

**Planned scope / changes:** Independent per-window document and library histories, cursor restoration, enclosing folder, basic source-link opening and cancellable recursive filename Quick Open. Search excludes hidden/symlink/build/dependency folders and caps at 20,000 entries or 100 results.

**Checks:** ./bin/build and ./bin/test passed at this increment (39 tests). Final combined build revalidated all 39 tests; existing Qt Material teardown warnings remain. Native checks below used the final combined build, not five separately installed bundles.

**Native verification:** Quick Open found two disposable fixtures and Return opened the first. Open Link at Cursor opened the second; Back restored the first cursor. Forward with unsaved sample changes prompted; Cancel preserved them. Agent edits were undone and sample saved clean. Sample-only screenshots visually inspected.

**Known gaps:** History is session-local and New resets it; not coordinated across windows. Source links support basic inline/autolinks, not reference links or nested parentheses. Local nontext targets are unsupported. Native large-library stress, full keyboard/dark/narrow checks and earlier Move To/separate-volume/tooltip timing QA remain pending.

**Runnable artifacts:** dist/Omawrite Dev.app (stable io.github.andrewjngray.omawrite.dev) and dist/Omawrite.app refreshed after normal QA-app close; ordinary package signature verification passed. Logs: research/cycle-20a/logs/. Changes remain uncommitted alongside earlier work.

**Optional exercise:** In the examples location, Quick Open “Cycle20”; follow Second sample, go Back, edit, then try Forward and Cancel.

## Cycle 20b — command palette and sentence focus (in progress)

Planned scope: searchable existing workspace commands with keyboard navigation and live enabled/check states; sentence focus using Unicode sentence boundaries within the current paragraph, with fenced source focused by line. Paragraph and sentence modes are mutually exclusive. This is a defined local subset, not an English grammar/abbreviation model or full-menu palette. Build/test and native sample checks required before closeout. Remaining cycles 21–28 retain their existing scope and are not marked complete.


## Cycle 20b — Command palette and sentence focus (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Search the shared workspace registry; Unicode sentence focus within the active paragraph.

**Verification:** Command-Shift-P, query → Return, and visible sentence dimming passed natively. Boundary tests pass. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Palette covers the existing workspace registry, not every new file/edit command. Unicode sentence boundaries are not an abbreviation/language grammar model; broader language/performance checks remain.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-20b/README.md). Open Command-Shift-P, type sentence, press Return, and move through sample sentences.


## Cycle 21a — Bounded saved-content search (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Recursive filename/content search off the UI thread; a per-query in-memory content index is rebuilt from saved files. Limits: 100 results, 20,000 entries, 256 KiB per file, 32 MiB total; unreadable/oversized files reported. Hidden/symlink/build/dependency folders excluded.

**Verification:** Automated saved edit/rename/delete and stale-query checks pass. Live exact-tag content search found the sample. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Not a persistent index: rereads bounded files. Unsaved buffers are excluded. Tree/list/date options not confirmed beyond existing controls; native large-library stress remains.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-21a/README.md). Quick Open → Search saved file contents too; search a phrase absent from filenames.


## Cycle 21b — Saved queries and tags (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Persist up to 30 root-scoped queries; remove/reopen them in Quick Open. #tag queries match case-folded tags outside basic fences/inline/indented code. Open content searches refresh every five seconds. Hashtag insertion added.

**Verification:** Saved-query persistence and code exclusion tests pass. Native #sample search and Save query passed; persisted query survived restart. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Saved queries are in Quick Open, not organizer smart-folder rows. Nested Markdown code cases and a browsable tag index remain; these are partial smart-folder semantics.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-21b/README.md). Search #sample with content enabled, save the query, and reopen it.


## Cycle 22a — Preview navigation (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Unique heading slug targets, inserted Markdown TOC, and opt-in proportional bidirectional scrolling with a feedback guard.

**Verification:** Duplicate-heading TOC and actual rendered anchor lookup pass. QML loading/regression tests pass. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Scroll synchronization is proportional, not semantic paragraph/image alignment. Full long-document native anchor/scroll and cross-file fragment checks remain.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-22a/README.md). Insert a TOC into a disposable document and follow duplicate-heading links in preview.


## Cycle 22b — Markdown extension subset (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Preview-only ==highlight==, explicit relative [[target|label]] links, single-line footnotes and bounded local text/Markdown content blocks. Literal code preserved; include depth 5, 256 KiB per include, 1 MiB total, cycles/escaping outside the current include directory refused.

**Verification:** Automated literal-code/include-cycle/traversal tests pass. Native sample renders highlights, wikilink, footnote appendix, table and literal fenced code. Screenshot reviewed. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Wikilinks do not search nearest matches across the library. Multiline/backlinked footnotes, CSV/image/code content blocks, full title syntax and rebasing ordinary relative links inside nested includes remain. Missing includes show a message.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-22b/README.md). Open examples/Cycle28-QA.md and compare source to preview.


## Cycle 23a — Export and print (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Atomic HTML/PDF export, rendered/source print and native page setup. Exports preserve editor source/dirty state and refuse overwriting the active source. HTML carries its source base URL.

**Verification:** 48-test final suite includes real HTML/PDF output checks. Basic Unicode heading/bold PDF rendered with Poppler and visually inspected. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Native export picker cancellation, multi-page/image/table layout, page-break insertion and portable asset bundling remain unverified/unimplemented. Exported HTML links local assets; moving the HTML alone is not a self-contained export.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-23a/README.md). Export a disposable sample as PDF and inspect every page before sharing.


## Cycle 23b — Output style foundation (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Three independently named output font presets plus local JSON custom fontFamily/pointSize (8–32) validation.

**Verification:** Compiled and covered by QML/export regression suite; native custom-style workflow not yet verified. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** This is a font-style foundation, not complete preview/output templates. No persisted template selection, template asset system, headers/footers/title pages, paginated preview or fit-page/fit-width modes.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-23b/README.md). Try Reading Serif for an export; compare it with Clean Sans.


## Cycle 24 — Mac presentation subset (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Native Markdown share picker plus Minimize, Zoom and Bring All to Front; platform-specific Objective-C++ remains separate.

**Verification:** Native share picker opened on disposable prose and Escape dismissed it. No transmission performed. Build/QML tests pass. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Share-sheet open/cancel passed; remaining window-presentation checks remain. Title/toolbar fade/statistics-only modes and external-display behavior are not implemented in this pass.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-24/README.md). Open Share Markdown on disposable text and cancel without choosing a destination.


## Cycle 25a — Coordinated document windows (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** One Backend/QML engine per window in a shared process; same-file opens focus existing windows. Quit closes sequentially through normal save prompts; cancellation/save failure stops the sequence. Recovery slots remain isolated.

**Verification:** Native two dirty windows: New preserves first, Quit/Cancel preserves both, then Discard advances to second prompt. Tests cover new-window request and save-failure cancellation. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Separate application launches are not consolidated. Saved-window restoration across restart and exhaustive crash/OS-quit/minimized-window matrix remain. Clean windows already closed before a later Cancel are not reopened automatically.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-25a/README.md). Create two disposable dirty windows, Quit, then Cancel before discarding either.


## Cycle 25b — Native tabs (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** AppKit merge, next/previous, detach, overview and tab-bar controls. Reserve native tab-bar height below custom toolbar.

**Verification:** Live merge produced two native tabs; switching retained text; detach preserved unsaved text. Screenshot found a covered first line; corrected inset and reviewed final screenshot. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Restart restoration/tab-group persistence and exhaustive dirty-close/overview/fullscreen/keyboard states remain. Some tab commands remain enabled when not applicable.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-25b/README.md). Merge two sample windows, switch tabs, detach one and verify its draft.


## Cycle 25c — Opt-in autosave and saved versions (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Optional one-minute autosave for saved documents with disk-content comparison; pause on external changes. Explicit native NSFileVersion checkpoint of saved bytes under file coordination. Restore into editor as one undo step; disk changes only on Save.

**Verification:** Autosave external-change protection tested. Native checkpoint creation, listing, restore and undo back to prior dirty sample passed. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** No automatic version capture per save or native Versions-browser UI. Versions cover Markdown, not authorship sidecars. Autosave has a remaining external-writer race between comparison and write; disk-full/disconnection/crash stress remains. Default is off.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-25c/README.md). Create a saved-file version; edit a sample; restore; undo before deciding whether to Save.


## Cycle 26a — Native spelling subset (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Selection spelling review through NSSpellChecker and Emoji command. Native platform Edit menu also exposes system Dictation/AutoFill where available.

**Verification:** Native selection spelling correctly reported the sample typo “quikc”. Build/QML tests pass. Emoji/dictation remain unverified. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Inline spelling/grammar, automatic substitutions/corrections, speech and completion integration remain. Selection spelling reports words only; no suggestions or replacement workflow.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-26a/README.md). Select disposable prose and run Check Selection Spelling.


## Cycle 26b — Writing analysis foundation (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Selection analysis through system lexical classes and a small review-word list; comma-separated custom review words. Limit first 50,000 characters and 1,000 results.

**Verification:** Native analysis reported sample Determiner/Adverb/Adjective/Noun classes and flagged “really” as a review word. Screenshot inspected. Broader language corpus remains unverified. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Analysis is an explicit panel, not live parts-of-speech highlighting/style checking. Select prose manually; code not excluded automatically. No exact iA linguistic-output claim.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-26b/README.md). Select prose, Analyze Selection, and judge whether review words are useful.


## Cycle 27 — Manual authorship annotations (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Explicit Human/AI/Reference labels with optional author; Unknown clears labels. QTextDocument formatting ranges participate in undo and edits. Hidden .<filename>.omawrite-authors.json sidecar stores ranges with SHA-256 source match; external text changes invalidate them. Recovery snapshots include annotations.

**Verification:** Native selected Reference label and Save passed. Tests cover mark undo/redo, sidecar save/reopen and external-edit invalidation. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Annotations are assertions, not verified provenance. Inserted text can inherit nearby labels. Clipboard/export, Duplicate/Move/Rename sidecar migration, paste-edits/author-aware merging and full attribution visualization remain. Native versions do not version sidecars.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-27/README.md). Select sample words, mark Reference, Save; keep the hidden sidecar with the Markdown file.


## Cycle 28 — Release/parity audit — still open (21 September 2026 closeout pass)

**Planned scope / changes:** Integrate new slices, review samples, run regressions, package/sign locally and record remaining acceptance gaps honestly.

**Verification:** Final build and all 48 tests passed. Ordinary and stable Dev bundles refreshed; package deep/strict signature verification passed. Sample-only screenshots reviewed and basic exported PDF visually inspected. Final combined 48-test suite passes.

**Known gaps:** Not full parity or release sign-off. Complete the acceptance gaps in this matrix and earlier Move To success/separate-volume, exact tooltip timing, clipboard cross-app, accessibility/dark/narrow/picker checks. No notarization/public release.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Both stable bundles refreshed. [Evidence](../research/cycle-28/README.md). Use the new sample and report one concrete surprise at a time.


## Cycle 29 — Authorship through file operations (closeout increment)

**Planned scope / changes:** Preserve authorship sidecars through Duplicate, Rename and Move. Duplicate records current buffer annotations, including unsaved changes. Rename/Move carry saved metadata with saved Markdown while retaining dirty annotations and undo in the editor. Destination metadata collisions and source metadata symlinks block migration. Metadata is staged before changing the source path; failed duplication rolls back its newly created metadata. If old metadata cannot be safely removed, retain it and report cleanup needed.

**Verification:** `./bin/build` passed; `./bin/test`: **51 passed, 0 failed**. Regression coverage includes dirty annotations, save/reopen, collision protection, rollback, rename-dialog window retention, undo and recovery snapshot metadata. Native sample Duplicate, Rename and same-volume Move passed; resulting sidecar hashes and annotation ranges verified on disk. A previous apparent empty-window switch was investigated: the original renamed document remained open in the same process and reopening its path focused it. Repeat Rename kept the correct window active. No data-loss reproduction and no speculative focus fix; the original focus switch remains unexplained.

**Known gaps:** Two-file operations are not crash-atomic transactions. Cross-volume/device-removal and concurrent external-writer stress remain unverified. Clipboard/export provenance, native version sidecars and full recovery-relaunch matrix remain future work. Session/tab restore and cross-launch ownership are separate closeout items. Cycle 28 release/parity audit remains open.

**Artifact / exercise:** `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app`; [evidence](../research/cycle-29/README.md). On a disposable annotated document, Duplicate, Rename and Move, then reopen and check authorship. Report any repeat of an unexpected focus change.


## Cycle 30 — Open a file or folder by path

**Planned scope / changes:** User-requested File → Open by Path command (Shift–Command–O on macOS), also available in the editor file menu. Accepts absolute local paths, `~/`, paired outer quotes and local `file:///` URLs. C++ validates and canonicalizes existing readable folders or Markdown/text files; QML routes files through the existing unsaved-change guard and folders to the library without replacing the current document. Inline errors keep the dialog open.

**Verification:** Build passed; **53 tests passed**. New tests cover spaces/Unicode/hash characters, encoded URLs, quotes, home expansion, symlinks, missing/unsupported/nonlocal paths, folder opening with a dirty document, and file-open Cancel/Discard. Native Shift–Command–O, home-relative file path, folder path, invalid-path message and dirty-open Cancel passed. Sample-only error screenshot reviewed.

**Known gaps:** No relative paths, shell expansion, environment variables, path completion or remote URLs. File types match the library's Markdown/text extensions. Dark/narrow and permission-revocation races not independently exercised.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Stable `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and packaged `dist/Omawrite.app`; [evidence](../research/cycle-30/README.md). Press Shift–Command–O and paste `~/Documents`, then try a Markdown file path containing spaces.


## Cycle 31 — Filter field label and rounded edges

**Scope / changes:** Andrew reported the filter placeholder floating above its outline on focus, and the right curve disappearing when narrowing. Use a Basic TextField with explicit colors/padding/insets, a fixed placeholder, a content-independent implicit width, zero minimum layout width and a maximum constrained to the library's inner width. Rounded background follows control height.

**Verification:** Build and 54 tests pass. QML geometry checks cover 1100/900/720-pixel windows and long input while focused. Native focus/typing checked on a sample-only library; fixed label and both rounded ends visually inspected. Screenshot in research/cycle-31. Native resize gestures did not resize the window, so minimum-width verification is automated rather than a claimed native drag pass.

**Known gaps:** Independent native minimum-width drag and dark-mode visual checks remain. Existing broader closeout gaps unchanged.

**Artifact / exercise:** Stable Dev and packaged app updated. Focus Filter files, type a query, and narrow the library; both ends should remain inside its bounds. See [evidence](../research/cycle-31/README.md).

## Cycle 32 — Workspace restart and launch coordination

**Scope / changes:** One owner per installed executable, with local-socket forwarding for repeated launches and canonical-path duplicate focus. Saved-file windows retain bounds, library root and cursor; macOS tab grouping/order and last active document survive Quit/relaunch. Workspace metadata uses atomic owner-readable files. Existing orphan recovery snapshots are opened before saved-session files so dirty recovered buffers are not overwritten by restoration. Save As during a Quit prompt updates the saved session URL. OS Quit events use the guarded close sequence.

**Verification:** Build and **56 tests passed**. Added workspace round-trip/corrupt-input/rejected-write checks and concurrent secondary-launch forwarding, including Unicode/spaces and activation-only requests. Native sample checks: second executable opened another file and exited; repeated launch selected the existing tab; Merge All Windows, Quit/relaunch restored two tabs in order; cursor position 2 survived; dirty Quit → Cancel retained text, Undo restored the sample, and Save completed Quit. Final active-document state stays recorded while another app has focus. Reviewed sample-only screenshot retained.

**Known gaps:** Dev and ordinary app installations are deliberately separate owners. Missing saved files and clean untitled windows are skipped. Normal bounds are restored; minimized/fullscreen state and external-display placement are not reproduced. Existing sequential quit can close earlier windows before a later Cancel; it does not reopen those windows. Crash/recovery/disk-full and multiple dirty-window/OS-shutdown stress remain in Cycle 34. Session metadata has a one-second checkpoint interval; existing dirty-text recovery remains separate. Native Save As during Quit not independently exercised.

**Artifacts / exercise:** Stable `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app`; [evidence](../research/cycle-32/README.md). Open two disposable documents, merge them as tabs, place the cursor partway through one, Quit and reopen. Verify order and cursor; explicitly closing a document removes it from the next restored session.

**Next:** Cycle 33 themes. [Ten cycles remain in the updated plan](remaining-cycles.md), including themes; full iA parity remains unclaimed.

## Cycle 33 — Workspace themes

**Scope / changes:** Aa → Theme offers Follow system (reset), Light, Dark and Warm paper. Persisted selection updates existing windows. Shared palette covers writing surfaces, preview, library/organizer, chrome, filter, menus and in-app dialogs; blue folder/gray file icons retained. macOS native window appearance follows the selected light/dark mode. Export/print styling is independent.

**Verification:** Build and 57 tests passed. Tests invoke theme menu actions, check persistence/manual overrides/reset, text/modified preservation and 4.5:1 text/muted contrast against panels. Native Warm paper and Dark visually inspected on synthetic sample tabs; restart retained Dark and switching to the second tab retained the theme. Native tab bar now changes appearance. Sample-only screenshots reviewed.

**Limits:** Bundled presets only; no Typora CSS imports or theme editor. macOS native tab labels can be faint while the app is inactive; broader accessibility/system-picker/high-contrast audits remain in Cycle 41. Linux custom Omarchy colors retain their existing behavior in Follow system and are not native-tested here.

**Artifact / exercise:** Stable Dev build; ordinary package refreshed with the following safety increment. Aa → Theme → Warm paper, then Dark; compare the library and preview and report a preferred default. Reset with Follow system. [Evidence](../research/cycle-33/README.md).

## Cycle 34a — Recovery baseline and cancellable multi-document Quit

**Scope / changes:** Recovery snapshots now retain the last known disk baseline with owner-only permissions. Autosave after recovery refuses externally changed files; older snapshots without a baseline recover text but require manual Save. Autosave checks read errors and rechecks the target after staging a write; short writes report failure. Quit gathers Save/Discard decisions for every document before closing any windows. Document revisions invalidate earlier approval if edited before the final close. A later Cancel retains earlier drafts/windows, including recovery data.

**Verification:** Build and **59 tests passed**. An isolated test subprocess created two annotated drafts, waited for snapshots, and exited without cleanup; the parent recovered both text and annotations. One file was externally changed between exit/recovery and autosave preserved that external content; the unchanged file autosaved normally. QML test confirms discard approval does not close or clear a draft and later edits change its revision. Native two-dirty-tab Quit: Discard First → Cancel Second retained both drafts/tabs; repeat Discard both exited normally. Reviewed synthetic screenshot retained.

**Known gaps / remaining Cycle 34:** This closes two concrete safety issues, not the entire safety cycle. A non-cooperating writer can still change a file in the short interval between final comparison and atomic rename; portable filesystem APIs do not provide compare-and-swap. Physical disk-full/removal, fullscreen/minimized/external-display restoration and full OS-shutdown stress remain. Version snapshots still cover Markdown rather than sidecars; no automatic per-save version history or native Versions browser. Save As during multi-document Quit still needs dedicated native verification. No fabricated completion count: nine planned cycles remain, including the unfinished portion of 34.

**Artifact / exercise:** Stable Dev and ordinary app refreshed; [evidence](../research/cycle-34a/README.md). On two disposable drafts choose Quit, Discard on the first and Cancel on the second. Both should remain open with their text. Then save or discard normally.

## Cycle 34b — Safe version restoration

**Scope / changes:** Native versions remain Markdown-only snapshots. Restoring a version now inserts unlabelled historical text instead of inheriting current authorship; one Undo restores the preceding text and annotations together. Restoring explicitly pauses autosave until a successful manual Save. The pause is written to recovery metadata and restored with the draft, and the version dialog explains this policy. New/open documents reset the pause.

**Verification:** Build and **61 tests passed**. A native NSFileVersion test creates a saved version, changes and annotates current text, restores, verifies autosave leaves disk untouched, verifies one-step Undo/Redo of text and labels, then saves/reopens unlabelled text. It checks the recovery snapshot records the autosave pause. Failed Save As to a missing destination preserves the current URL, draft, original file and Undo. Native Dev sample Create Version → edit → Restore → Undo passed; status and dialog explain the pause. Disposable edit discarded on normal Quit. Sample-only screenshot reviewed.

**Limits / remaining Cycle 34:** Native snapshots do not include sidecars; this cycle defines safe unlabelled restoration rather than claiming historical provenance. No automatic version capture on each save or native Versions-browser UI. Disk-full/device-removal, fullscreen/minimized/display restoration and OS shutdown matrix remain. The pause remains after Undo until manual Save, conservatively requiring an explicit decision. Full crash/relaunch of a version-restored draft was not separately exercised; recovery flag serialization is tested. Nine planned cycles remain, including unfinished Cycle 34.

**Artifact / exercise:** `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app`. [Evidence](../research/cycle-34b/README.md). On a sample file create a saved version, edit, restore it, then Undo. Choose Save explicitly to accept restored text.

## Cycle 34c — Automatic previous-version history

**Scope / changes:** Opt-in File → Keep Previous Version on Save preserves changed existing saved bytes before replacement. Checkpoint failure blocks Save; unchanged saves avoid duplicate versions. Markdown-only version policy retained.

**Tests:** Build and 62 tests pass, including native NSFileVersion previous-byte capture and deduplication. Native UI verification is part of the combined Cycles 34c–38 run.

**Limits:** Not native Versions-browser UI or sidecar history. External non-cooperating-writer race, OS-shutdown, physical disk/device and display/window-state matrix remain open.

**Artifact / exercise:** Stable Dev/ordinary bundles updated at the combined run. Enable Keep Previous Version on Save on a sample; change and Save, then restore its earlier version and Undo.

## Cycle 35 — Authorship clipboard and inspection

**Scope / changes:** Editor Markdown Copy/Cut carries custom hash-bound annotation metadata; Paste validates ranges and prevents external plain text inheriting labels. One Undo reverses pasted text and annotations. Annotation rows select their spans; explicit metadata JSON export includes provenance limitations.

**Tests:** Build and 63 tests pass; range clipping, transfer, stale hash rejection, Undo and metadata export covered. Native routes checked in combined run.

**Limits:** Assertions are not verified authorship. Other apps may strip custom MIME data. Exported HTML/PDF does not embed assertions; matching Markdown and metadata are separate artifacts. Collaborative merging/full live attribution visualization remain future work.

**Artifact / exercise:** Combined stable bundles. Mark a sample Reference, copy/paste it within Omawrite, inspect its range, then Undo. Paste plain text from another app and confirm it is unlabelled.

## Cycle 36 — Footnotes and richer content blocks

**Changes:** Multiline footnotes with repeated-reference backlinks; named-anchor lookup in preview; rebased links/images in nested Markdown includes; wiki fragments; local image, escaped CSV and literal code content blocks. Existing bounds retained.

**Tests:** Build and 64 tests pass. New cases cover multiline notes, repeat backlinks, nested relative assets, CSV quoting/escaping, inline code and wiki fragments. Native combined preview check follows.

**Limits:** Not a complete Markdown parser. Nearest-match wiki lookup, complex nested inline links, semantic scroll synchronization and the full long-document/fragment matrix remain open.

**Artifact / exercise:** Combined bundles. Preview an included chapter with a local image, a quoted CSV and a multiline footnote; follow its return link. Source files remain unchanged.

## Cycle 37 — Persisted output templates and portable raster images

**Changes:** Persisted output styles/custom font, size, header/footer and optional title page. PDF/print share paginated output with page counters. Page-break insertion uses a Markdown comment. HTML embeds bounded local raster images; unavailable assets reject export and retain prior output.

**Tests:** Build and 65 tests pass. Persisted style, embedded image, page break and export rollback covered. Rendered two-page PDF visually reviewed; corrected a boundary defect that moved the preceding image to page 2. Corrected images/text/headers/footers inspected in output-final evidence. Native picker checks follow in combined QA.

**Limits:** No in-app paginated/fit-page preview; document hyperlinks may remain external. Full title-page/custom template and physical printer matrix remains open.

**Artifact / exercise:** Combined stable bundles. Select Reading Serif, insert a page break, export a two-page PDF and HTML with a local PNG. Move the HTML and confirm the image remains embedded.


## Cycle 38 — Organizer searches and browsable tags

**Scope / changes:** Saved queries appear as organizer smart folders and reopen their saved root/query/content setting. Explicit Refresh scans saved Markdown/text tags asynchronously, counts documents, and opens tag queries. Quote/list-contained fences are excluded. Independent cancellation/generation guards discard stale root results. Document shortcuts now target the active window: native two-tab QA exposed ambiguous application-wide Command-S.

**Tests:** Build and 66 tests pass. New 110-document fixture verifies counts, repeated-tag deduplication, nested code exclusion and root-reset behavior. Native sample tag scan shows two writing documents, tag click returns both files, and Save query creates a sidebar smart folder. Sample screenshots reviewed.

**Limits:** Manual refresh, saved files only; no filesystem watcher/incremental index. Bounds: 20,000 directory entries, 256 KiB/file, 32 MiB total, 2,000 tags; hidden/symlink/build/dependency paths excluded. Very large-library latency/memory and full Markdown-container grammar remain acceptance work. Quick Open results have their own limits, so counts can exceed visible results.

**Artifact / exercise:** `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app`. Open research/cycle-38/sample/Workbench.md, Show in Library, show organizer, Refresh Tags, click #writing and save the query. See [combined evidence](../research/cycle-38/README.md).

### Combined native verification — Cycles 34c–38

Native Dev opened the synthetic workbench without changing existing writing. Preview displayed the nested chapter, quoted CSV, literal code and multiline/repeated footnote. Tag counts and tag-to-Quick-Open passed; saved query appeared in organizer. Reference Copy/Paste retained both annotation ranges, and one Undo removed pasted text. Optional previous-version capture produced a native restore entry after File → Save; history preference returned to off. PDF save picker opened and Cancel returned to the saved document. PDF pages were separately rendered and inspected under cycle-37/output-final. All committed screenshots contain synthetic writing; Recents was collapsed.

Outstanding: full cross-app clipboard matrix, annotation-row focus timing, footnote click/long-scroll matrix, title-page/custom-template/printer checks, external-display and OS-shutdown/device-failure tests. These five checkpoints advance the plan; they do not close every acceptance criterion in Cycles 34–38.

Final native check: after rebuilding, Command-S saved the active Workbench.md with two tabs restored. The persisted #writing smart folder returned both sample documents after restart. QA app quit normally with saved documents.

## Cycle 39 — Native writing review

**Scope / changes:** macOS spelling suggestions, explicit language choice and opt-in grammar review with individual Replace; replacement verifies expected text and is one Undo. Review masks fenced/indented/inline code, URL destinations and raw tags while preserving UTF-16 offsets. Writing Review refreshes while its non-modal panel is open. Speak Selection and Stop Speaking use the system voice. Annotation row selection waits for its dialog to close.

**Tests:** Build and 67 tests pass, including real macOS dictionary suggestions, code exclusions and stale replacement/Undo. Native dialogs and speech checked during final combined QA.

**Limits:** First 50,000 characters, 100 spelling/grammar issues, 1,000 analysis results. Dictionaries/language grammar quality depend on macOS; no automatic correction while typing, full Markdown grammar or iA-equivalent linguistic model. Speech uses AppKit's supported but deprecated synthesizer. Hardware/audio perception and all languages need user acceptance.

**Artifact / exercise:** Combined stable Dev/everyday bundles. On a sample containing `mispellled` and fenced code, use Edit → Spelling and Grammar, replace a suggestion and Undo. Try Writing Review and Speak Selection. Evidence: research/cycle-39/logs.


## Cycle 40 — Command access and interaction

**Scope / changes:** Palette now covers file/path, save/save-as, duplicate/rename/move, reveal, quick-open/tags, export, themes and writing/annotation tools. Disabled state checks match required file/library context. Palette execution waits for closure. Path tooltips use independent two-second hover timers; annotation range selection waits until its dialog is closed. Paginated Preview shares PDF/print painting and offers fit/page/orientation controls.

**Verification:** Final combined build and 70 tests pass; palette routing/disabled rename/pagebreak Undo tested. Native palette → Spelling and Grammar and Paginated Preview passed. Both preview pages visually inspected.

**Limits:** Remaining reference submenu/context-menu and rapid-hover timing matrix is open, as are native tab-action enabled states and title/toolbar fading. See release-acceptance.md.

**Artifact / exercise:** Stable Dev and ordinary RC1. Command-Shift-P → Paginated Preview; try fit controls and Cancel. Hover a library path and report any premature tooltip.

## Cycle 41 — Integrated QA and fixes

**Scope / changes:** Dark preview links now use readable theme colors and underlines; editor accessibility name added. Session capture retains normal bounds, display name and minimized/fullscreen/maximized state; restoration clamps to the available display. Native long-document QA found Qt drops empty named anchors; rendered-link fallback now resolves footnote destinations and repeated references. Synthetic tag limits and custom title-page output validated.

**Verification:** Build and 70 tests pass, including off-screen geometry, tag caps/oversized skip, actual Qt footnote anchors and command behavior. Native spelling Replace/Undo, grammar request, paginated preview, fullscreen two-tab restart and long-note forward jump passed. Speech commands invoked; audible quality not independently verified. Custom three-page PDF rendered and all pages reviewed. Synthetic screenshots only.

**Limits:** Hardware shutdown/disks/displays, minimized matrix, VoiceOver/cross-app clipboard, exact hover timing and language breadth are not certified. A failed native resize attempt is excluded; automated width checks pass. No blanket accessibility/parity sign-off.

**Artifact / exercise:** Both RC1 bundles; research/cycle-41 contains samples, screenshots and PDF evidence. Open Long-notes.md and follow/return from the note; try the spelling panel on Closeout.md.

## Cycle 42 — Versioned Mac release candidate

**Scope / changes:** App version 0.2.0-rc1, bundle 0.2.0/build 42. Updated user guide and current acceptance ledger. Ordinary packaging now refuses to overwrite a running app, matching Dev. Archive script verifies committed compiled inputs and produces a packaged ZIP, source/build manifest and SHA-256 checksums; MIT/font licenses retained. GitHub prerelease archives the binary separately from source Git history.

**Verification:** Final build, 70 tests, shell syntax checks and deep/strict bundle-signature verification. Package and archive evidence under research/cycle-42/logs. Both stable bundles refreshed. Release metadata identifies the source commit.

**Limits / status:** RC1 is for personal use, Apple Silicon/macOS 14+, ad-hoc signed. Developer ID/notarization and other-machine install are not complete. All numbered areas now have implementation checkpoints, but outstanding software parity and hardware acceptance in release-acceptance.md remain open; this does not reset the strict remaining-work count to zero.

**Artifact / exercise:** dist/Omawrite.app, dist/Omawrite Dev.app and GitHub mac-v0.2.0-rc1 prerelease archive. Use a copy of a document for a final personal acceptance session; report any issue against the candidate tag.

Final RC1 native follow-up: modeless Writing Review stayed visible during input and updated its word classes. Long-note forward and return clicks both passed (preview scroll 100% → approximately 2% on return). Sample edit undone and saved normally.

## Cycle 43 — Location and file context menus

Scope: Andrew's iA Writer screenshot: Rename in Locations, Remove from Locations, Copy Library Path, Show in Finder; applicable path/Finder actions on library folders/files, favorites and recents.

Implemented a shared QML context menu with right-click and Menu-key invocation. Location labels persist separately from disk names. Removing a location removes only the shortcut; missing locations remain available for shortcut maintenance. Copy Path writes a decoded local filesystem path. Show in Finder targets the clicked entry, without opening it in the editor. No file deletion or arbitrary on-disk rename added to this menu.

Validation: ./bin/build and ./bin/test: 71 passed, zero failures. New coverage checks label persistence, invalid labels/targets, clipboard paths with spaces, and file preservation after shortcut removal. Initial sandbox run could not access native spelling/recovery services; rerun with required access passed. Native Dev: location menu, rename/apply/restore label, file menu without document switch, and Finder selection of Workbench.md verified. Sample screenshots/logs: research/cycle-43/. Keyboard Menu-key, dark appearance, unavailable-volume menu and VoiceOver not verified natively.

Runnable artifacts: dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app (same current source; GitHub RC1 archive remains the previous checkpoint).

Optional exercise: right-click a location and give it a shorter label; right-click a file, copy its path, and reveal it in Finder. Confirm the folder's real name has stayed unchanged.

## Cycle 44 — Full file and folder context action sets

Scope: implement Andrew's two supplied iA screenshots for editable Markdown/text files and folders, retaining the separate Cycle 43 location-shortcut menu. Hidden submenu contents were not supplied; Omawrite uses its supported output formats.

Changes:
- Files: Open in New Tab / Window, Get Info, Favorite toggle, Duplicate, Rename, Move to Trash, Show in Finder, native Share picker, Export HTML/PDF, Print rendered/source/preview, Copy path/Markdown/plain text/HTML, New File/Folder, Sort By and View Options.
- Folders: Open as library root, Get Info, Favorite toggle, recursive Duplicate, Rename, Trash, Finder, native Share, Copy Library Path, New File/Folder inside that folder, Sort By and View Options.
- File output/duplication uses the live buffer when already open; closed-file output uses an isolated backend without claiming recovery slots or replacing an editor document. Existing documents retain one editing owner; opening an already-open file focuses it. Tabs use native AppKit groups; new windows/tabs inherit the originating library root.
- Filesystem rename relocates library roots, location labels, favorites, recents and folder navigation paths. Location rename remains a sidebar alias.
- Trash asks before moving to the system Trash, never permanently deleting. Dirty open files must be saved/closed first. A clean open file becomes an unsaved untitled draft after Trash, preserving its content for Save As. Folder rename/duplicate/Trash requires documents inside it to be closed. Folder copies stage before publication, refuse links/special files, and cap at 20,000 entries / 1 GB; larger copies can use Finder. Filesystem roots cannot be renamed, duplicated or trashed. Sharing sends the saved file/folder through the system picker, not unsaved buffer text.

Validation: ./bin/build and ./bin/test pass, 73 tests, zero failures. New tests cover clicked-file output/clipboard, refusal to export over the source, duplicate collisions, traversal rejection, recursive copying and symlink refusal, folder rename remapping, unsaved-buffer duplication/rename, dirty Trash and open-descendant folder guards. A canonical /var → /private/var rename mismatch was found and fixed.

Native Dev QA on synthetic samples: complete file/folder menus; duplicate then Trash of the created copy; New File in the clicked folder; native new-tab grouping; Get Info; correct clicked-document paginated preview while another document is active; Copy Markdown pasted into the filter then cleared; native file sharing picker displayed and cancelled without transmission. Submenu popup visibility and action-after-dismissal bugs found and fixed. Sample screenshots in research/cycle-44/screenshots. Existing documents were preserved through normal app quits.

Known gaps: no physical print job or actual sharing transmission; dark/VoiceOver/keyboard-only context traversal, unavailable volumes and cross-process editing in the separate Dev/everyday identities were not exercised. Saved smart-search roots are not migrated by folder rename. Folder copy is a bounded synchronous operation and does not preserve every macOS extended attribute/ACL. Unseen iA submenu parity remains unverified.

Artifacts: dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app. Versioned RC1 GitHub release remains the older checkpoint; this cycle is recorded in source history and local bundles.

Optional exercise: right-click an unopened note, duplicate it, rename the copy, export/preview it and move the copy to Trash. Right-click a folder and create a file inside it; try the sorting and date/excerpt controls. Report whether the menu order feels natural.

## Cycle 45 — Locations rename the real folder

Scope: Andrew found that renaming a Location changed only its sidebar label while Finder retained the original disk name. Replace the alias-only menu action with a physical folder rename.

Changes: Locations now offer **Rename Folder…**, using the same validated filesystem operation as library folders. The dialog starts with the actual disk name. Successful rename clears that folder's legacy sidebar alias and updates location URLs, root, favorites, recents, navigation and saved-search roots. Old aliases are not automatically applied to disk; run Rename Folder to perform the intended rename. Remove from Locations remains shortcut-only.

Validation: ./bin/build and ./bin/test pass (74 tests, zero failures). Regression checks cover a legacy alias followed by physical rename, name collision rejection, preserved child file, persisted new root/location name, recents, saved-search root and copied path. Existing tests cover open-descendant refusal and unsaved-buffer preservation. The first test run exposed test settings leaking into a later search test; scoped restoration fixed test isolation.

Native Dev: normal quit/restart retained the three existing sample tabs. Opened cycle-45/sample/Before through Open by Path, right-clicked its Location, chose Rename Folder, and renamed to After. Sidebar and header changed; Show in Finder selected the actual cycle-45/sample/After folder. Filesystem check confirmed Before absent and Note.md unchanged. Sample screenshot and verification logs are in research/cycle-45/. Everyday app closed normally before packaging.

Known limits: documents inside a folder must be closed before rename; cross-process editing in another app is not coordinated. Unavailable volumes, permissions failures, case-only renames and VoiceOver were not exercised natively. Rename uses a dialog, not iA's inline text field.

Artifacts: dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app. GitHub RC1 downloadable binary remains Cycle 42; source history records this fix.

Optional exercise: close documents inside the location, right-click it → Rename Folder, then Show in Finder. Confirm the new name and contents in both places. An old alias such as sample_b needs this real rename once.

## Cycle 46 — Non-overlapping Locations and child Favorites

Scope: implement Andrew's approved Locations/Favorites distinction and preserve the reasoning. Locations represent independent directory trees. Favorites provide shortcuts into those trees.

Changes: explicit Locations + rejects parent/child overlap in either direction and exact duplicates, identifies the conflicting Location, and offers Add to Favorites instead. Paths are canonicalized and compared on component boundaries. Favorite addition is idempotent. Navigation/open-by-path can browse overlapping folders without creating Locations. On startup, existing overlaps are normalized to outermost Locations and nested entries are retained as Favorites; no files are moved. See [decision record](location-design.md) for migration and evidence versus inference about iA.

Validation: ./bin/build and ./bin/test pass, 75 tests, zero failures. New coverage checks child-first/parent-first rejection, exact duplicates, similarly named independent folders, symbolic links, invalid URLs, Favorite idempotence, navigation/back, and persisted order-independent migration. Both app bundles refreshed and deep/strict signatures verified.

Native Dev: three existing sample tabs survived normal quit/restart. Existing nested Locations migrated under Favorites with repo retained as the outer Location. Locations + selecting cycle-46/sample/Parent/Child produced the expected overlap dialog identifying repo. Add to Favorites instead created Child; clicking it showed Note.md and left Locations unchanged. Dialog and resulting sidebar screenshots use synthetic writing. Everyday app reopened with its prior document and migrated organizer. Logs/screenshots in research/cycle-46/.

Known limits: parent-first and child-first backend paths are tested, but only the child-add case was checked through the native picker. Dark appearance, VoiceOver, unavailable-volume aliases and cross-process concurrent settings changes were not certified. This does not implement a global library index. Existing alias names on migrated child shortcuts become their actual folder names in Favorites.

Artifacts: dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app. GitHub RC1 archive remains Cycle 42.

Optional exercise: use Locations + on a folder inside repo, choose Add to Favorites instead, then click its Favorite. Verify the folder opens without adding another Location and no files move.

## Cycle 47 — Unified preview/output templates

Scope: Andrew's View → Template screenshot. Unify selection across preview and output and add useful named presets with honest limits.

Changes: View → Template replaces Output Style and the separate Preview Typeface menu. Modern, Classic, Manuscript Mono, GitHub, Helvetica, Palatino, MLA Draft and Custom share persisted selection, font and C++ block/table formatting. Existing Sans/Serif/Mono quick commands now select the corresponding template. Preview footer names the active template; screen text size remains a reading adjustment. Markdown and editor typography are unchanged. PDF/print pagination now uses consistent point-based geometry and formatted-HTML normalization fixes Qt table-header alignment in preview and output. See [reasoning and preset details](template-design.md).

Validation: ./bin/build and ./bin/test pass, 76 tests, zero failures. New regression exercises all seven built-ins and return to Modern, live preview font/line-height, persisted selection, HTML output content, and unchanged source/modified state. Existing custom-style, page-break, rollback, recovery, links and Markdown tests pass. Tests now load bundled Mono fonts for representative export evidence. Existing Qt font alias/SplitView teardown warnings remain.

Visual QA: generated HTML/PDF specimens for all seven presets; rendered and inspected the seven single-page PDFs. This caught and fixed high-DPI geometry, decoration font scaling and first-header-cell alignment. Native Dev verified View → Template menu, GitHub selection, persisted GitHub after restart, corrected table rendering, MLA Draft, and return to Modern; source stayed clean. Both apps closed normally before refresh. Evidence under research/cycle-47/.

Known gaps: Duo/Quattro, full MLA compliance, iA template-package import, physical printing, dark/narrow/VoiceOver matrix, browser HTML rendering and long multi-page table stress remain unverified or unimplemented. Templates share typography/content styles, not identical line wrapping between differently sized screen/page surfaces. Continuous preview omits page decorations; use paginated preview.

Artifacts: dist/Omawrite Dev.app and dist/Omawrite.app. GitHub RC1 binary remains the older Cycle 42 download.

Optional exercise: open research/cycle-47/sample/Templates.md and use View → Template to compare Classic, GitHub and Palatino. Export or use Paginated Preview; report the preferred reading style and spacing.

## Cycle 48 — Selectable library date display

Planned scope: begin the screenshot-backed [menu closeout sequence](menu-closeout-plan.md) with View → View Options → Show Date. Make Date Modified, Date Created and None exclusive, expose the same choice through library menus, and migrate the old date visibility setting without changing sort order.

Changes: the library model now exposes separate created and modified date labels; an unavailable creation time is shown honestly. Native View, toolbar library options, sort popover and file context View Options share the one persisted date mode. The former `showDates` bool migrates to Modified or None on first use. None hides the row date; all three choices leave file sorting unchanged.

Validation: `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` pass, **78 tests, zero failures**. Added independent filesystem date and preference-migration cases; existing native command-state checks include the three choices. Dev bundle was prepared at the stable bundle ID and the ordinary app was packaged with a local ad-hoc signature. Logs and synthetic sample are in [research/cycle-48](../research/cycle-48/README.md).

Native Dev: opened `research/cycle-48/sample/First.md` in a new QA window, leaving the previously open documents untouched. View → View Options → Show Date presented all three entries. With the sample file's birth time at 2 January 2025 and modified time at 15 June 2026, the library row showed **2 Jan** and **15 Jun** respectively. None removed the date. The sort bar stayed **Sort by Date Modified** through the switches. The toolbar library menu exposed the same nested choices. Cropped sample-only screenshots show the two visible states.

Known gaps: native relaunch persistence, context-menu date choice, dark/narrow/VoiceOver and creation-time-unavailable volumes were not exercised in this live pass; persistence and invalid creation time are covered by tests. The creation-time sample needs `research/cycle-48/prepare-sample.sh` after a fresh checkout because Git does not retain birth/modified timestamps. Other View menu gaps remain on the audit.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app` from Cycle 48. The GitHub RC1 binary remains the earlier Cycle 42 checkpoint.

Optional exercise: run `research/cycle-48/prepare-sample.sh`, open its `sample/First.md`, and switch View → View Options → Show Date among the three choices. The file list should show 2 Jan, 15 Jun, then no date, without changing the sort order.

## Cycle 49 — Format menu closeout

Planned scope: match the captured Format groups and order; put Body at top level and Page Break under Format; add Ordered Task List and a conservative Clear Styles action. Keep unobserved formatting semantics and Omawrite's Change Case extra distinct from claims of iA parity.

Changes: Format now follows the observed Headings, Lists, Blockquote/Body, Structure, inline formatting, code, additions, rule/page-break and Clear Styles order. Ordered tasks generate numbered checkboxes, normalize existing list prefixes, preserve completed task state and support completion toggling without changing the numeric marker. Clear Styles acts on an explicit selection: it removes supported outer inline emphasis/strike/highlight wrappers and simple whole-line heading/quote/list/task prefixes, or refuses ambiguous code, links and nested constructs without mutation. Each replacement uses one undoable edit.

Validation: `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` pass, **80 tests, zero failures**. The added cases cover list conversion, completion, indentation, fenced refusal, nested supported styles and one-step Undo/Redo. The ordinary app confirmed the native Format hierarchy, ordered-task creation, completion and Undo with a synthetic file. That pass found a Clear Styles refusal for a bold heading; the source fix and regression test passed, and the refreshed Dev app then changed `## **Styled sample**` to `Styled sample`. Undo restored the original Markdown, and the sample was saved back to its original bytes. Both local bundles were refreshed and their signatures verified.

Known gaps: Clear Styles deliberately supports a bounded subset; complex mixed or nested Markdown, links and code remain untouched. Deep nested list behavior and cross-app Markdown rendering need later acceptance. The UI inspection tool timed out after closing disposable QA windows in both app identities; its cause remains unverified and belongs in the Window-cycle checks. No user writing was edited or force-closed. The [sample-only screenshot and native log](../research/cycle-49/README.md) record the corrected result. GitHub RC1 remains the older Cycle 42 binary.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app` from Cycle 49.

Optional exercise: open `research/cycle-49/sample/Format-actions.md`, choose Ordered Task List on its two task lines, complete one item and Undo, then select `## **Styled sample**`, choose Clear Styles and Undo. Confirm the menu placement and plain Markdown result.

## Cycle 50 — File and Edit menu hierarchy

Planned scope: align the observed File and Edit top-level hierarchy and group existing local commands without changing their safety semantics. Keep uncaptured iA submenu children unimplemented rather than inferred.

Changes: File now presents New-in-Library actions, Open/Recent, Close, Save, document operations, Versions, Finder/library reveal, Share, Export, Print and Page Setup in the captured groups. Omawrite-only file commands remain in an explicit Extras group. Edit now presents Undo/Redo, focused-field Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete/Select All, Copy Formatted/HTML/Markdown, Paste As, Find, Spelling and Grammar, Transformations, Speech and manual authorship actions. The macOS-injected Emoji & Symbols command remains at the end; Omawrite's duplicate entry was removed. Source-only copy formats require an editor selection; ordinary editing commands continue to follow the active editable field.

Validation: `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` pass, **81 tests, zero failures**. The new native-menu regression covers saved versus untitled guards, editor-focus copy-format enablement, Markdown/HTML/formatted clipboard results without source mutation, Find-field disabling of source-only copies, and a dirty File → Close → Cancel path that retains the draft. The full suite retains document, recovery and file-operation coverage.

Native Dev: the File/Edit hierarchy was inspected with `research/cycle-50/sample/Menu-actions.md`. Copy formats were enabled only for the selected editor text and did not change the sample. A disposable edit followed by File → Close → Cancel retained the draft; it was discarded through the normal unsaved-work prompt before quitting. No print, export or share job was sent. The QA app was closed normally.

Known gaps: the iA screenshots still do not expose the children of Revert, Share, Print, Paste As, Paste Edits From, Mark As, Find, Spelling, Substitutions, Transformations, Speech or AutoFill, so their exact iA behavior remains unverified. AppKit injects AutoFill, Dictation and Emoji & Symbols; their availability depends on macOS. Cross-application clipboard, actual sharing/printing, and full keyboard, dark, narrow and VoiceOver matrices remain open.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app` from Cycle 50. The GitHub RC1 binary remains the earlier Cycle 42 checkpoint.

Optional exercise: open `research/cycle-50/sample/Menu-actions.md`, select its bold phrase and try Copy Formatted, Copy HTML and Copy Markdown. Make a disposable edit, choose File → Close, then Cancel. Confirm the text remains and report any confusing order, name or disabled state.

**Cycle 50b follow-up — Transformations:** The 24 September iA capture and a synthetic iA text sample establish the four Edit → Transformations labels and order. Omawrite now presents Make Upper Case, Make Lower Case, Capitalize and Make Title Case in that order. Capitalize lowercases a selected plain-text range then uppercases each Unicode word initial; it uses the existing protected-selection refusal and one-step Undo path. A selected `tEST of THE wORLD` becomes `Test Of The World`, matching the observed iA sample. At the Cycle 50b checkpoint, Omawrite's Make Title Case used the same algorithm, while the iA sample yielded `tEST of the wORLD`; that distinct title-style behavior remains a gap. [Reference](../research/cycle-50/ia-capitalize-reference.txt).

Cycle 50b `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` pass with **102 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The new test covers captured menu order/labels, selection-preserving Unicode transformation, Undo and protected-link refusal. The refreshed Dev app reproduced the plain-text result and Undo in a disposable draft, then discarded that draft and returned to clean Second.md. The ordinary app was repackaged and reopened its saved document. Both bundles passed strict signature verification. [Native verification](../research/cycle-50/native-capitalize.txt). Known gaps include iA's distinct Make Title Case rules, punctuation/locale edge cases, native protected-context and accessibility checks. Runnable artifacts: current `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app`; neither bundle is in Git. Optional exercise: in a disposable draft, select `tEST of THE wORLD`, choose Capitalize, Undo, then compare Make Title Case and report expected treatment of small words.


**Cycle 50c follow-up — distinct Make Title Case:** A second isolated iA sample established `the QUICK BROWN fox and a DOG in new YORK` → `The QUICK BROWN Fox and a DOG in New YORK`; the earlier sample produced `tEST of the wORLD`. Omawrite now lowercases interior English minor words, capitalizes all-lowercase major words and preserves mixed/all-uppercase major words. This is an observed subset, not a general title-style or locale claim. Existing protected-selection refusal, selection preservation and atomic Undo remain.

`./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` pass **102/0/0**. The test covers both iA samples, Undo, Unicode Capitalize and protected-link refusal. Refreshed Dev reproduced the second Make Title Case sample and Undo in a disposable draft, then discarded it through File → Close and returned to clean Second.md. The ordinary app was repackaged and reopened clean README.md; both bundles passed strict signature verification. [iA reference](../research/cycle-50/ia-title-case-reference.txt), [native check](../research/cycle-50/native-title-case.txt), [build log](../research/cycle-50/build-50c.log), [test log](../research/cycle-50/test-50c.log). Unobserved punctuation, locale and style rules plus keyboard/dark/narrow/VoiceOver matrix remain gaps. Runnable artifacts: current local ordinary and Dev bundles. Optional exercise: select `the QUICK BROWN fox and a DOG in new YORK` in a disposable draft, choose Make Title Case, Undo, and report any capitalization you would prefer.

## Cycle 51 — Tree/List navigation and Preview menu

Planned scope: add the captured View Options → Navigation → Tree/List choice and View → Preview hierarchy, using the existing continuous and paginated renderers. Keep iA's uncaptured PDF submenu children and distinct Web semantics as explicit gaps.

Changes: the file library now persists Tree or current-folder List mode. List displays direct children; clicking a folder navigates into it with Back/Forward/Enclosing Folder history. Show in Library moves List to a nested document's containing folder. Switching modes at the same root retains the in-memory Tree expansion. Native View, library sort/options and file context menus share the mode and checked state. Preview Full/Split/Web uses the existing layout and continuous preview; PDF → Paginated Preview opens the existing page/fit controls. Editor Only remains a separate Omawrite action.

Validation: `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` pass, **82 tests, zero failures**. The added regression covers direct-child List rows, Tree expansion, folder history, nested Show in Library/reveal, mode persistence and native menu state. The ordinary and Dev bundles were refreshed and deep/strict signatures verified.

Native Dev: the synthetic three-note folder showed Child and Root-note in List; Tree expansion exposed Nested-note; clicking Child in List showed Nested-note and Grandchild, and Go → Back in Library returned to the root. Opening Deep-note by path revealed it in the List at Grandchild. The native View menu exposed Navigation → Tree/List and Preview → Full/Split/Web/PDF → Paginated Preview. Paginated Preview opened with Fit Page selected; Fit Width changed the checked fit control. No print job was sent. [Evidence](../research/cycle-51/README.md).

Known gaps: Tree expansion resets when changing the library root and is not restored across launches. List mode is a current-folder browser, not an all-files flattened list; this retains predictable folder actions and bounded scans. Web uses the existing continuous renderer, and iA's PDF submenu children remain uncaptured. Native dark/narrow, VoiceOver, keyboard-only traversal, unavailable folders and full menu-state relaunch were not exercised in this pass; mode persistence and unavailable-folder safety have automated coverage. No private writing was used for QA.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` and `dist/Omawrite.app` from Cycle 51. GitHub RC1 binary remains the earlier Cycle 42 checkpoint.

Optional exercise: open `research/cycle-51/sample` by path, use View → View Options → Navigation to switch Tree/List, open Child and use Go → Back in Library. Open `Child/Grandchild/Deep-note.md`, then use File → Show in Library. Compare View → Preview → Full/Split and PDF → Paginated Preview; report any confusing behavior.

## Cycle 52 — View chrome and statistics (in progress)

Planned scope: reproduce the captured Title Bar and Toolbar menu groups, add Default/Stats Only with independently selectable metrics, and define counts explicitly without claiming linguistic or authorship provenance accuracy. Keep macOS traffic lights and native-menu access available when QML chrome fades or hides.

Source changes: the statistics dialog and compact footer now include sentences, speaking time, task count and fully labelled manual Human/AI/Reference source-word counts. Stats Only preserves ten independent metric choices as shown in the iA screenshot. Title Bar offers Fade In/Out and Always Show; Toolbar offers Fade In/Out, Always Show and Hide. The top strip stays 44 px for native controls and dragging. [Counting and fade rules](../research/cycle-52/counting-rules.md) describe Omawrite's chosen semantics.

Validation so far: `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` passed at this checkpoint with **84 tests, zero failures**; the combined Cycle 54a source later passed 89. Focused tests cover counting, UTF-16 manual labels, live updates/Undo, independent menu checks, persistence and keyboard-focus reveal. The stable Dev bundle was refreshed on 24 September after a normal Quit. Its [native menu check](../research/cycle-52/native-menu.txt) found the View hierarchy and the fixture counts in the statistics dialog; selecting a Stats Only metric changed the footer, and Default restored it.

Known gaps: the Stats Only display is in Omawrite's footer rather than iA's top toolbar, and long selections elide visually while retaining a full hover/accessibility value. Sentence/task rules are conservative heuristics; authorship labels are manual assertions. iA fade timing was not captured. Live counts after editing/annotation, fullscreen, narrow/dark, high-contrast, VoiceOver, restart and traffic-light visual acceptance remain pending native QA. Screenshot capture was unavailable.

Optional exercise once Dev is refreshed: open `research/cycle-52/sample/Statistics.md`, compare View → Toolbar → Stats Only metric checks with the footer, edit a sentence and a task, then try Title Bar and Toolbar Fade/Hide. Confirm window controls and native View menu remain reachable.

## Cycle 53 — Go menu and organizer (source in progress)

Planned scope: expose saved locations, queries, recent files and current-library hashtags through the captured Go hierarchy. Keep unavailable roots and recent documents visibly unavailable, and refresh bounded local tag information without presenting stale counts as current.

Source checkpoint 53a: Go now offers Back/Forward, library navigation, Enclosing Folder, Open Link, Quick Search, Command Palette, dynamic Locations, Smart Folders and Hashtags. A saved query restores its root, text and content-search choice; New Smart Folder opens a blank query and persists only when saved. Hashtag selection opens a current-root search. Missing roots are refused without redirecting the active library. Recent files whose paths disappeared are disabled. Smart Folders → Recents is currently a nested recent-file submenu; the screenshot shows a direct Recents action, so exact structure remains partial.

Source checkpoint 53b: a complete small-root hashtag scan attempts to watch at most 256 file and directory paths, debounces changes by 400 ms and rescans. Partial scans, failed watcher registration and unavailable folders explicitly require manual refresh. Changing the library root cancels the previous generation so its tags cannot be published in the new root.

Validation so far: `./bin/build` passes. The full `./bin/test` suite passed at this checkpoint with **88 tests, zero failures and zero skips** using native macOS access; the combined Cycle 54a source later passed 89. A restricted sandbox run had nine older spelling/recovery/process/watcher failures and is not the acceptance result. New coverage exercises query persistence, unavailable roots, hashtag routes, watcher fallback and recents. The refreshed Dev app exposed the [Go menu](../research/cycle-53/native-menu.txt), and a temporary one-file root automatically added #beta after an external saved-file edit. No private writing was used.

Known gaps: a full incremental content index and iA smart-folder semantics are outside this bounded pass. For a root over the watch cap, or when macOS rejects a watch, external edits can make counts stale until Refresh Hashtags; the menu states that limitation. Saved-query roundtrip, unavailable-root UI, atomic replacement, large-root fallback, keyboard and narrow/dark layout remain unverified. Screenshot capture was unavailable.

Runnable artifact: `dist/Omawrite.app` was packaged from Cycle 53 source and passed strict local-signature verification. `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` is now refreshed through Cycle 54a source; the Cycle 53 native checks above are partial. See the [Cycle 53 record](../research/cycle-53/README.md) and [usability checklist](../research/usability/cycle-53.md). Optional exercise: open the sample root, use Go → Quick Search and New Smart Folder, save a query, then edit a sample tag externally and check its status and refresh behavior.

## Cycle 54 — writing input (phases 54a–54c partial)

Planned scope: reproduce captured View → Show Completions and inspect Edit → Substitutions/AutoFill children before assigning automatic writing behavior. Preserve source, Undo, IME composition and recovery. The 24 September iA native menu capture now supplies child labels but not substitution triggers or Undo rules.

Source checkpoint 54a: Show Completions is a manual action with current-document Unicode candidates in a small popup. Acceptance revalidates source/caret and replaces one prefix atomically; there is no automatic insertion. Code and URL contexts are excluded. Candidate discovery is bounded to the first 50,000 UTF-16 code units, at most 256 matching occurrences and 12 results.

Source checkpoint 54b: Edit → Substitutions → Smart Quotes is a persisted, opt-in toggle. A directly typed straight double quote becomes an opening or closing curly double quote using the immediately preceding character; existing text is never scanned or rewritten. The literal keystroke and automatic replacement use separate document edits, so the first Undo restores the straight quote and the second removes it. The handler refuses selected text and IME composition, and does not run for paste. Fenced, indented and inline code, bare URLs, Markdown link destinations and incomplete raw tags retain straight input. Text Replacement, capitalization and automatic correction remain absent.

Source checkpoint 54c: Edit → Substitutions → Smart Dashes is a separate persisted opt-in toggle. Based on an isolated iA sample, only the directly typed second hyphen in a spaced prose pair such as `one -- two` becomes an em dash. The first Undo restores the literal pair and the second removes the second hyphen. It shares Smart Quotes' refusal of selections, IME composition, paste, modified shortcut input, fenced/indented/inline code, bare URLs, Markdown link destinations and incomplete raw tags. Line-leading rules/front matter, adjacent third hyphens and unobserved unspaced forms remain literal. Existing text is never scanned. No other dash rules are inferred.

Validation: Cycle 54c `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` suite pass with **101 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Focused Smart Dashes coverage checks persisted menu state, disabled behavior, the two-stage Undo sequence and code/URL/link/raw-tag refusals. In refreshed Dev, the menu exposed both independent toggles: default-off `--` stayed literal, enabled spaced prose became an em dash, one Command-Z restored the pair, and disabling the option left later input literal. The ordinary bundle reopened a clean saved document; both bundles passed strict signature verification. The Dev UI bridge timed out on the disposable draft's Discard action, so the final Dev close state is unverified. The preceding Cycle 54b native pass verified Smart Quotes typing/Undo; Cycle 54a displayed two local suggestions for `lan`, accepted one and restored the prefix with Undo. See [native evidence](../research/cycle-54/native-smart-dashes.txt), [iA observation](../research/cycle-54/native-smart-dashes-reference.txt) and [cycle gaps](../research/cycle-54/README.md).

Known gaps: candidates beyond the bounded window are omitted. Smart Quotes and the observed `--` Smart Dashes rule are implemented as bounded opt-in subsets. Text Replacement, Smart Copy/Paste, automatic correction/capitalization and AutoFill remain unimplemented; additional unobserved dash rules are deliberately absent. IME, paste, selection, non-US layouts, popup visuals, arrow keys, Escape, narrow/dark and accessibility remain pending native checks. [Optional sample exercise](../research/usability/cycle-54.md): request a completion for `lan`, accept and Undo; then try Smart Quotes and Smart Dashes in prose and protected Markdown contexts.

## Cycle 55 — Focus and review (phases 55a–55c partial)

Planned scope: align captured Focus menu hierarchy without changing the existing focus/highlighter behavior, then separately add live lexical/style review overlays with source and performance safeguards.

Source checkpoint 55a: Focus → Enable Focus Mode now contains Sentence, Paragraph and Typewriter in captured order. Sentence and Paragraph remain exclusive; Typewriter scrolling stays independent. Writing Review… follows as an Omawrite-specific action. No master toggle or Markdown/highlighter mutation was added.

Source checkpoint 55b: Focus → Enable Style Check → Custom is a persisted opt-in command. It highlights matches from the existing Writing Review custom-word list and refreshes about 200 ms after text or setting changes; turning it off clears the overlay immediately. The offset-preserving prose mask excludes fenced, indented and inline code plus URL syntax. Work is bounded to the first 50,000 UTF-16 units, 32 unique comma-separated terms of at most 64 units and 1,000 ordered, non-overlapping matches. Markdown styling and focus formatting are retained, while search highlighting keeps priority. Highlighting does not edit source, move the caret or add Undo history.

Source checkpoint 55c: Focus → Enable Style Check → Fillers is a second persisted toggle beside Custom. Its explicit starter set is `very`, `really`, `quite` and `just`, matched case-insensitively at Unicode whole-word boundaries. Custom and Fillers merge into one globally ordered, non-overlapping result stream under the shared 50,000-unit/1,000-match caps; an exact overlap is labelled Custom. Each category can be disabled immediately without clearing the other. The same prose mask excludes fenced, indented and inline code, URL destinations and raw tags. No Clichés, Redundancies or Show Syntax entries were added.

Validation: `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` suite pass with **96 tests, zero failures and zero skips** at the Cycle 55 checkpoint. Focused tests cover merged UTF-16 offsets/order/caps, overlap precedence, independent toggle persistence/clearing, exclusions, composition with Markdown/focus/search formats and unchanged source/caret/Undo/modified/annotations. The refreshed stable Dev app exposed both Fillers and Custom. Toggling Fillers on the synthetic `research/cycle-47/sample/Templates.md` document left source and saved status unchanged. A later live CUA view of `research/cycle-55/sample/Fillers.md` visibly showed yellow highlights on prose `really`, `very`, `QUITE`, `just` and link-label `quite`, while `veryish`, the URL destination, inline/fenced/indented code and raw tag attributes had no yellow. Status remained `Opened Fillers.md`. No screenshot file could be persisted. [Fillers native record](../research/cycle-55/native-fillers.txt), [Custom native record](../research/cycle-55/native-custom.txt) and [Cycle 55 record](../research/cycle-55/README.md).

Known gaps: Clichés, Redundancies and parts-of-speech Show Syntax categories are unimplemented. The live Fillers color/exclusion matrix was visually checked, but no screenshot artifact was saved. Native checked marks, Custom color/overlap appearance, dimming/scroll feel, keyboard traversal, narrow/dark/fullscreen and VoiceOver remain unverified. Runnable artifact: refreshed `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` with current combined source; ordinary `dist/Omawrite.app` still contains Cycle 53 source. [Optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-55.md).

## Cycle 56 — Authors setup (phase 56a partial)

Planned scope: implement only the captured pre-setup Authors → Set Up Authorship… flow. A required Name and optional Identifier form a local profile. Post-setup iA menus and assignment behavior were not observed, so this phase does not infer them.

Changes: macOS now places Authors between Format and View. Its setup sheet trims and persists a nonempty Name of at most 100 UTF-16 units and an optional Identifier of at most 200, rejecting control characters. Save remains disabled until the profile is valid; Cancel retains the previous profile. Reopening edits the saved profile as an explicit Omawrite choice. The profile never edits Markdown, adds Undo/recovery state, writes an authorship sidecar or labels text. Edit → Authorship Annotations remains the separate manual-label workflow.

Validation: `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` suite pass with **94 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Automated coverage verifies invalid and valid forms, trimming, Save, Cancel, persistence across reopen, and unchanged source, status, modified/Undo state, authorship ranges, sidecar and recovery contents. The refreshed stable Dev app exposed Authors → Set Up Authorship… and its blank sheet. Save was disabled until a synthetic Name was entered; Cancel returned to the unchanged sample source and status. Native Save/reopen was not exercised to avoid leaving a fake profile. Screenshot capture was unavailable. See the [native record](../research/cycle-56/native-menu.txt) and [Cycle 56 record](../research/cycle-56/README.md).

Known gaps: post-setup iA behavior is unknown. There is no author registry, automatic authorship assignment, verified provenance, Mark As or Paste Edits From parity. Native profile persistence, validation errors, keyboard traversal, dark/narrow layout and VoiceOver remain unverified. Runnable artifact: refreshed `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` with combined Cycle 55c/56a source; ordinary `dist/Omawrite.app` remains Cycle 53 source. [Optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-56.md).

## Cycle 57 — bundled Help and Window Center (phases 57a–57b partial)

Planned scope: add useful local Help and What’s New pages without inventing an Online Support destination or duplicating macOS Help search behavior. Keep the viewer isolated from document editing and recovery.

Changes: Help now offers Omawrite Help and What’s New in Omawrite before the existing Keyboard Shortcuts entry. Both pages are bundled Markdown resources and open in a read-only, scrollable in-app view that closes with its button or Escape. A fixed backend allowlist exposes only the two resource IDs; unknown or missing pages return a safe local error. The content describes current local-file workflows, safety boundaries and recent features without private paths or network access.

Validation: `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` suite pass with **97 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Automated coverage verifies both resources, traversal refusal, safe missing-page text, menu routing, read-only rendering, Escape, retained Keyboard Shortcuts and unchanged dirty-draft source/caret/Undo/modified/status/recovery. The refreshed stable Dev app exposed the Help menu; macOS accessibility verified both bundled pages, Close and Escape. The synthetic `research/cycle-47/sample/Templates.md` source and status remained unchanged. Screenshot capture was unavailable. See the [native record](../research/cycle-57/native-help.txt) and [Cycle 57 record](../research/cycle-57/README.md).

Phase 57b changes: Window → Center now appears after Zoom, is enabled for a normal window and invokes AppKit’s native `NSWindow center`. It does not add Zoom All, Fill, tiling, display movement or a dynamic document list. The automated two-window geometry check centers only the target near its current screen’s available center, retains its size and the other window’s geometry, and preserves dirty source, modified status and Undo state.

Combined validation: `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` suite pass with **99 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The stable Dev app was refreshed with combined 57b/58a source. Window → Center was visible, enabled and invoked on synthetic Target.md with unchanged clean status. An app-only live capture showed the source and preview, but its crop did not establish the window’s on-screen center and no screenshot was saved. See the [Center native record](../research/cycle-57/native-center.txt).

Known gaps: Help screenshot/pixel styling, dark and narrow layouts, link/scroll behavior, VoiceOver and OS Help search were not checked. Center’s exact OS geometry and multi-display behavior remain unverified; geometry is automated offscreen only. Online Support remains absent because no destination was verified. Zoom All, Fill and remaining Window/application-menu AppKit closeout remain open. Runnable artifact: refreshed `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` with combined 57b/58a source; ordinary `dist/Omawrite.app` remains Cycle 53 source. [Optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-57.md).

## Cycle 58 — local fragment navigation (phase 58a partial)

Planned scope: make explicit local Markdown/text heading fragments useful without broadening the parser or output stack. Keep fragment navigation behind the existing guarded open path and preserve plain Markdown, Undo and dirty-document safety.

Changes: inline links to `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdown`, `.txt` and `.text`, matching wikilinks and same-file `#heading` links now resolve heading fragments from the source editor, Go → Open Link and rendered preview. Heading slugs follow the existing preview/table-of-contents rule, including duplicate suffixes such as `#same-1`. The fragment is removed before file/history/library identity is recorded. A successful cross-file open moves the source caret and queues the preview jump until the target Markdown has parsed; same-file navigation does not reload the document. Dirty Cancel and failed opens retain the original document, caret and scroll.

Validation: Cycle 58a initially passed 98 tests; the later combined 57b/58a `./bin/build` and full native-access `./bin/test` pass with **99 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Automated coverage uses the synthetic [`Source.md`](../research/cycle-58/sample/Source.md) and [`Target.md`](../research/cycle-58/sample/Target.md) shape to verify inline and `[[wiki#fragment]]` links, duplicate `#same-1`, Go and preview routes, fragment-free identity, same-file navigation, unchanged source/Undo, dirty Cancel and failed-open caret/scroll retention. The refreshed stable Dev app opened Source.md by path; after the caret was placed in the inline link, Go → Open Link opened Target.md with clean status and no `#` in the title. A later live screenshot displayed the second `Same` heading with the caret at its start. No screenshot file was persisted, and precise preview scrolling was not confirmed visually. See the [native record](../research/cycle-58/native-fragments.txt) and [Cycle 58 record](../research/cycle-58/README.md).

Known gaps: a target already owned by another window is focused through the existing window routing, but the fragment jump is not transferred to that window. A valid document with a missing heading opens without a jump or dedicated missing-anchor message. Native visual scroll position, screenshots, dark/narrow layout, keyboard-only traversal and VoiceOver remain unchecked. This phase is local navigation support, not complete Markdown parser or output parity. Runnable artifact: refreshed `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` through 58a; ordinary `dist/Omawrite.app` remains Cycle 53 source. [Optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-58.md).

## Cycle 59 — integrated acceptance checkpoint (implemented subset)

Scope: consolidate the current menu map, automated gate, bundle state and native evidence without treating matching labels or selected samples as full iA Writer parity. The tested product code is commit `5f8d64b` on macOS 27.0.

Build and artifacts: final `./bin/build` and the full native-access `./bin/test` suite pass with **99 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` succeeded. Both `dist/Omawrite.app` and `dist/Omawrite Dev.app` were refreshed, locally ad-hoc signed and strict signature-verified. The ordinary running app was normally quit after saving its open README.md status; the refreshed ordinary bundle reopened saved README.md with Authors present. Dev remained clean on synthetic Fillers.md. [Build log](../research/cycle-59/build.log), [test log](../research/cycle-59/test.log) and [native record](../research/cycle-59/native-qa.txt).

Integrated evidence: Cycles 48–58 inspected all ten top-level menu families through accumulated native passes. Latest live checks include visible Fillers matches/exclusions with unchanged status, both bundled Help pages, the fragment target caret at the second `# Same`, and Window → Center invocation with unchanged target status. A disposable Safety.md pass exercised File → Close on a dirty draft: Cancel retained the starred title, edit and Unsaved status; a later Discard closed only that disposable draft and returned to saved Second.md. The final disk SHA-256 matched its initial value. No user writing was edited or discarded. No screenshot file was persisted. This evidence is representative; it does not cover every saved, untitled and dirty state or every enabled-state transition.

Classification and gaps: **implemented-subset integrated checkpoint, not full closeout**. Cycle 54 substitutions remain absent. Cycle 55 lacks Clichés, Redundancies and Show Syntax. Cycle 56 lacks observed post-setup authorship semantics and iA-style Mark As/Paste Edits. Cycle 57 retains incomplete application/Window OS actions and unverified real/multi-display Center geometry. Cycle 58 retains parser/output/cross-app gaps plus cross-window and missing-anchor fragment behavior. VoiceOver, dark/narrow, multi-display and a complete ten-menu state matrix are unverified. Both current apps are local ad-hoc artifacts; the GitHub RC1 remains the older Cycle 42 release. [Cycle 59 record](../research/cycle-59/README.md) and [usability checklist](../research/usability/cycle-59.md).

## Cycle 60 — Fomawrite identity and repository rename

Planned scope: rename the visible product and ordinary/QA app identities, executables, build/package scripts, Linux package metadata and repository while preserving plain Markdown, recovery, authorship sidecars, upstream attribution and the historical record.

Changes: `Fomawrite.app` and `Fomawrite Dev.app` use new stable bundle IDs and Fomawrite menu/window/help labels. The qmake target, test binary, package names and current build/development docs follow the new name. First launch copies old Qt preferences and matching workspace/recovery files into the new namespace without removing the old state; a marker prevents repeat recovery import. Existing `.omawrite-authors.json` sidecars and clipboard MIME remain readable because they are established data formats. The GitHub repository is renamed to `andrewjngray/fomawrite_mac`; upstream history remains unchanged.

Tests: `./bin/build` passed; full native-access `./bin/test` passed **102/0/0**. Both bundles were packaged/prepared and passed strict signature verification. Native QA launched both newly named apps with saved sample documents, saw Fomawrite menus, and confirmed the previous library location, favorites and sort setting migrated after a first-launch migration correction. [Logs and native record](../research/cycle-60/README.md).

Known gaps: Linux packaging was edited but not run on Linux. macOS may request fresh per-app permissions because bundle IDs changed. The local checkout directory remains `omawrite_mac`; old release archives/tags retain their historical names. Developer ID signing, notarization, marketing/trademark clearance and a newly branded public download are separate distribution work.

Runnable artifacts: local `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`, both generated and excluded from Git. Optional usability exercise: open Fomawrite Dev with a disposable Markdown file, confirm your library shortcuts/settings, make an unsaved edit and test Quit → Cancel before saving or discarding it.

## Cycle 61 — local checkout path rename

Planned scope: rename the physical local Git checkout from `omawrite_mac` to `fomawrite_mac` without losing uncommitted work, breaking Fomawrite saved paths, or changing product behavior.

Changes: moved the existing checkout with its Git history and uncommitted sample files intact. Rebased only the exact old checkout prefix in the ordinary app's favorites, recents, saved-search roots, location labels, last-save directory and saved workspace snapshot; the Dev app had no old-path preferences. Generated qmake files were regenerated by the normal build and test scripts. No product source code changed. The old path has no compatibility symlink because the Codex executor rejects symlinked writable roots.

Validation: `./bin/build` succeeded at the new path and `./bin/test` passed **102 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Both local app bundles passed strict signature verification. `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` launched from the renamed checkout; the installed ordinary app reopened its clean saved document and showed a `fomawrite_mac` favorite. Preferences and workspace snapshots were checked for the exact old prefix after migration. See [verification record](../research/cycle-61/verification.txt). No screenshot was committed because the live sidebar contains private shortcuts.

Known gap: the Codex desktop app's saved project registration still points to the old folder and this task's filesystem permission remains anchored there. Re-add or relink the project at `fomawrite_mac` before starting the next Codex task. The physical folder rename itself is local and does not appear in Git; this record is the portable history. Other external applications with independently saved absolute paths were not exhaustively audited. Runnable artifacts: local `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` under the renamed checkout. Optional usability exercise: open the new checkout favorite, a saved search and a recent sample Markdown file, and report any missing path.

## Cycle 62 — canonical Markdown and visual-edit mapping foundation

Planned scope: establish a conservative source-to-visual mapping before making the rendered pane editable. Preserve plain UTF-8 Markdown exactly across view changes, and identify syntax that must stay source-only.

Changes: added `SourceVisualMapping`, a UTF-16 offset projection for supported paragraph, ATX-heading, list-item, emphasis/strong and inline-link-label text. It retains the original source byte-for-byte and returns a bounded single-span replacement only for mapped text. Code, tables, footnotes, images, comments, raw HTML, escaped constructs and reference links are source-only. The architecture and fixture corpus are recorded in [research/cycle-62/README.md](../research/cycle-62/README.md).

Tests: `./bin/build` passed. Both focused mapping tests passed (4 total Qt test functions including setup/cleanup). The combined `./bin/test` run reported 103 passed and one failure in the existing native Window Center geometry check; a second agent run instead hit an existing recovery-file numbering check. The mapping tests passed in both runs. This cycle has no QML/native feature to verify, so no Dev app was replaced or inspected.

Known gaps: no editable preview yet, no multi-line/IME/paste or cross-marker transformations. The full-suite environment-sensitive failures need isolation before an integrated release claim. Runnable artifact: `build/Fomawrite.app` from the combined source checkout. Optional exercise for Andrew: none yet; Cycle 64 will provide the first visual-edit surface for review.

## Cycles 63–69 — visual writing and export closeout

The following records describe the combined source state on 25 September 2026. The integrated automated suite passes **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Final `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` passed; the stable `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` was refreshed and inspected with a disposable sample. Native acceptance remains partial as specified under Cycle 69.

### Cycle 63 — compact writing controls

The top-right chrome now has accessible Bold, Italic, Link and paragraph-format controls, with a single Format control at narrow widths. Link opens a target/title popover and uses the established Markdown command; bold and italic reuse existing wrapping. `ChromeButton` labels inherit italic styling. Native keyboard-only, VoiceOver, dark-mode, narrow-layout and link-title checks remain pending. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-63.md).

### Cycle 64 — visual editing baseline

Visual Edit is a separate plain-text projection over canonical Markdown. One bounded inline change is applied through `Backend::applyVisualEdit`; stale, syntax-bearing, multiline and source-only edits are rejected. It uses document Undo, preserves bounded selection, waits for IME composition, routes Control-Z/Control-Y to source Undo/Redo and offers a Source route. Destructive native Edit actions are disabled while it is focused. This is not general WYSIWYG Markdown: tables, code, footnotes, images, comments, raw HTML, escaped constructs, reference links and structural/multiline changes are source-only. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-64.md).

### Cycle 65 — conservative visual styling

`VisualTextHighlighter` applies presentation-only heading, strong, emphasis and link-label styling from mapping-owned spans, and differentiates source-only blocks. The editable subset remains ordinary paragraphs, headings, list-item content and supported inline text; no Markdown is inferred from formatting. Simple quote bodies and task-item bodies are editable while their Markdown markers remain protected. Nested structures, image insertion, multiline paste/drag/drop and visual-surface formatting actions remain unimplemented; source-formatting commands explicitly route visual focus back to Source. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-65.md).

### Cycle 66 — unified export hub

The upper-right Export control and File → Export HTML/PDF open `ExportHub`, which selects PDF/HTML, style, paper, orientation and destination. It exposes Share Markdown, a clearly labelled continuous preview and separate native paginated preview. Paper/orientation persist through the existing page-layout model. The direct File → Share Markdown native action remains available. Continuous preview is not page-exact; native output comparisons, cancellation/failure, dark/narrow layout and accessibility checks remain pending. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-66.md).

### Cycle 67 — Fomawrite-owned output style gallery

The Export hub now has a responsive gallery for built-in Fomawrite styles and local user styles. A user can duplicate the current style and edit its name, font family, point size, header, footer and PDF header/footer and title-page settings, or delete it. The versioned app-data JSON catalog is capped at 64 styles/64 KiB, uses UUIDs and atomic save. Invalid/malformed/oversized catalogs are left untouched; built-in selection clears stale custom selection. No Ulysses presets/assets, thumbnails, margins/spacing/hierarchy controls or import are included. A disposable native style was duplicated, selected and deleted; restart persistence and HTML/PDF appearance comparisons remain pending. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-67.md).

### Cycle 68 — scoped output CSS

HTML export accepts a user-selected local CSS file. It must be a regular, non-symlinked UTF-8 file no larger than 64 KiB; external assets, `url()`, imports, font-face declarations, namespaces, embedded markup, URLs and control characters are refused. Valid CSS is embedded only into exported HTML and the local selection persists. PDF and Markdown remain unaffected. DOCX/ePub and Ulysses style import are absent; a future importer requires demonstrated mapping and rights review. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-68.md).

### Cycle 69 — integrated acceptance (partial checkpoint)

Scope and changes: integrate source mapping and guarded visual editing, compact writing controls, export hub, local style gallery and output-only CSS. The native pass found and fixed visual typing Undo grouping, accidental source formatting from visual focus, style-copy selection, and gallery button clipping in its 245 px panel. Simple quote/task bodies were added to the conservative editable subset. The iA Writer acceptance ledger remains open.

Tests and native verification: final `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` pass with **111/111 tests**. The refreshed stable `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` opened a saved synthetic sample. Native QA verified source-preserving bold replacement, a single Command-Z for contiguous visual typing, quote-body edit/Undo, source-format command refusal while visual focus was active, built-in style switching, user-style duplicate/select/delete, PDF options, and the corrected gallery button layout. The ordinary installed app was left running and untouched. No screenshot was committed because the sidebar displayed private location shortcuts. [Sanitized native record](../research/cycle-69/README.md).

Known gaps: Visual Edit remains a bounded inline subset, not a general WYSIWYG editor. Multiline/complex nested Markdown, images, tables, code and several insertion commands stay source-only. The continuous export preview is not page-exact. Saved HTML/PDF visual comparisons, custom CSS selection in the final native bundle, style restart persistence, dirty/recovered/multiwindow/external-edit cases, long files, dark/narrow/fullscreen layout, keyboard-only navigation and VoiceOver remain for a later acceptance pass. DOCX/ePub and Ulysses style import are not built. These gaps prevent claiming the full Cycle 69 acceptance gate or iA Writer parity.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` is refreshed with the clean synthetic sample open for review. `dist/Fomawrite.app` was packaged from the same source; both generated bundles passed strict local signature verification. `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was not replaced. [Exercise](../research/usability/cycle-69.md).

## Cycle 70 — selected macOS app icon

Planned scope: use Andrew's selected third concept, with Markdown source on the left, formatted text on the right and a blue divider, as Fomawrite's app icon. Keep the mark original and readable at Dock sizes, without changing editing behavior or the installed ordinary app.

Changes: added a source SVG and a reproducible QtSvg/iconutil generator for a multi-resolution `Fomawrite.icns`. qmake now copies the icon into the app bundle and the macOS Info.plist names it, so the ordinary and stable Dev bundles use the same product mark. The icon source is vector and the generated resource is committed for reproducible packaging.

Validation: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The generated Info.plist was regenerated after qmake had retained its prior copy; both final bundles contain `CFBundleIconFile=Fomawrite.icns` and identical icon resources. Both passed strict local signature verification. The 1024 px and 64 px renders were visually inspected; refreshed Dev launched successfully. Finder/Dock appearance remains Andrew’s review item. See [Cycle 70 evidence](../research/cycle-70/README.md).

Known gaps: the light icon has not been checked in every macOS Dock appearance or at every scaled size. It is a local design asset, not a notarized public release. The installed `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` remains separate from generated `dist/` bundles.

Runnable artifacts: generated `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` after packaging. [Optional usability exercise](../research/usability/cycle-70.md): compare the icon in Finder and the Dock at small and large Dock settings, then report whether the source/preview meaning remains obvious.

## Cycle 71 — simpler writing icon

Planned scope: follow Andrew's updated selection of the middle icon from the original three-concept board: two dark-grey writing lines and a blue insertion caret, with no grey connecting stroke. Retain the existing bundle identity and icon build workflow.

Changes: replaced the Cycle 70 split-view artwork in the editable SVG and regenerated the multi-resolution `.icns`. Both ordinary and Dev bundles continue to use the same icon metadata and product name. The previous artwork remains available in Git history.

Validation: the 1024 px and 64 px renders were visually inspected; `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. Both generated bundles contain `CFBundleIconFile=Fomawrite.icns` and an identical icon resource, and both passed strict local signature checks. The refreshed Dev app launched to a clean Untitled document. Finder/Dock appearance at different scales remains Andrew’s review item. See [Cycle 71 evidence](../research/cycle-71/README.md).

Known gaps: Dock/Finder appearance across all scales, dark backgrounds and macOS icon caching still warrants Andrew's review. This is a local ad-hoc build, not a public release. `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` remains untouched.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` after refresh. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-71.md): compare the new Dock icon against the previous Cycle 70 design and judge legibility at your normal Dock size.

## Cycle 72 — final short-connector app icon

Planned scope: finish Andrew's side-by-side icon comparison by adopting the short grey connector beside the two dark writing lines and blue caret. Keep product identity and editing behavior unchanged.

Changes: selected the short-connector vector from the three-option comparison and regenerated the committed multi-resolution `Fomawrite.icns`. The no-stroke Cycle 71 and extended-stem alternatives remain documented by the comparison; the short connector is the final product mark.

Validation: the 1024 px and 64 px renders were inspected. `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded. Both generated bundles declare `CFBundleIconFile=Fomawrite.icns`, carry the same icon resource as the source `.icns`, and pass strict local signature verification. The refreshed Dev app launched to a clean Untitled window. See [Cycle 72 evidence](../research/cycle-72/README.md).

Known gaps: Dock/Finder rendering can be cached by macOS and has not been inspected across every scale and appearance. These are local ad-hoc bundles, not a notarized public release. The installed `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was not replaced.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-72.md): glance at the Dev Dock icon at your usual Dock size and check that the short connector reads clearly.

## Cycle 73 — restore the running macOS Dock icon

Planned scope: address Andrew's screenshots showing a generic Dock placeholder after the final icon was installed. Keep the approved short-connector artwork and the existing product/bundle identities.

Changes: the macOS runtime no longer overrides its icon with an empty `QIcon::fromTheme("fomawrite")`. The icon generator now writes a matching PNG from the approved SVG, the Qt resource bundle embeds it, and the application and every QML window set it explicitly. Linux retains the themed icon path.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The old theme lookup was confirmed null; the compiled Qt resource rendered a non-null 64 px icon. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` passed, with strict signature verification. Both refreshed apps launched to clean Untitled windows. The old installed app was closed normally, and `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was updated and verified to match the generated executable and `.icns`. See [Cycle 73 evidence](../research/cycle-73/README.md).

Known gaps: the Dock itself was not captured through the UI tool. A pinned tile may retain macOS icon-cache state until refreshed; Andrew should check both ordinary and Dev tiles. This remains a local ad-hoc build, not a notarized public release.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-73.md): glance at both Dock tiles and confirm the writing icon replaces the generic grid.

## Cycle 74 — rounded macOS app tile

Planned scope: address Andrew's Dock screenshots showing the short-connector mark on a small white card inside an oversized white square. Make the icon read as a distinct rounded app tile comparable in scale to Outlook, preserving the selected writing mark.

Changes: the SVG now has a transparent canvas with one large cool-gray rounded tile, subtle border and shadow, and larger writing lines and blue caret. Regenerated the PNG and multiresolution `.icns` from the same vector source.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded. The old ordinary and Dev windows were clean and closed normally before replacement. Both refreshed apps launched to clean Untitled windows; the installed executable and icon match `dist/Fomawrite.app`, and strict signature verification passed. macOS's `NSWorkspace` initially returned its cached old icon; after Launch Services registration and a Dock restart it returned the new rounded tile. See [Cycle 74 evidence](../research/cycle-74/README.md).

Known gaps: the Dock itself was not captured through the UI tool, so Andrew should judge the result at his own Dock size and desktop appearance. This remains a local ad-hoc build, not a notarized release.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-74.md): compare both Dock tiles with Outlook against light and dark backgrounds.

## Cycle 75 — white-face rounded app icon

Planned scope: correct the Cycle 74 interpretation of Andrew's Outlook comparison: keep the rounded gray border but return the icon face to white.

Changes: replaced the gray-filled tile with a white face and narrow cool-gray rounded rim; retained the short-connector writing mark and blue caret. Regenerated the PNG and multiresolution `.icns` from the vector source.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed; `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded. With the app closed, the signed build was installed in `/Applications`; the executable and `.icns` match the packaged app. It launched, and `NSWorkspace` resolved the installed icon to the white-face design after macOS icon registration and a Dock restart. See [Cycle 75 evidence](../research/cycle-75/README.md).

Known gaps: Andrew's visual check in his own Dock remains useful; the Dock itself was not captured. This is a local ad-hoc build, not a notarized release.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-75.md): compare the white face and gray rim beside Outlook at your usual Dock size.

## Cycle 76 — pure-white app icon face

Planned scope: match Andrew's OneDrive reference more closely by removing the visible gray border from the white Fomawrite tile while retaining subtle three-dimensional depth.

Changes: replaced the bordered tile with a single pure-white rounded face over a soft offset shadow. The short connector, dark writing lines and blue caret remain unchanged. Regenerated the PNG and multiresolution `.icns` from the vector source.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed; `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded. Andrew saved and quit the installed app before replacement. The installed executable and `.icns` match the signed packaged app; it launched, and `NSWorkspace` resolved the borderless white icon after Launch Services registration and a Dock restart. See [Cycle 76 evidence](../research/cycle-76/README.md).

Known gaps: Andrew's visual check in his own Dock remains useful; the Dock itself was not captured. This is a local ad-hoc build, not a notarized release.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-76.md): compare the white tile beside OneDrive at your usual Dock size.

## Cycle 77 — cmux-inspired off-white icon

Planned scope: soften the pure-white Cycle 76 tile to match the slightly off-white face in Andrew's cmux Dock screenshot while keeping the borderless shape and gentle dimensional shadow.

Changes: sampled the cmux screenshot's near-white top and light-gray bottom, then applied a subtle `#fefefe` to `#eeeeee` vertical gradient to the Fomawrite face. The writing mark, blue caret and shadow remain unchanged. Regenerated the PNG and multiresolution `.icns`.

Tests: `./bin/build` passed; `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded. See [Cycle 77 evidence](../research/cycle-77/README.md).

Native verification and known gaps: the installed app was left untouched while it was running, then replaced after it exited. The installed signed executable and `.icns` match the packaged bundle. The app launched, and `NSWorkspace` resolved the off-white icon after Launch Services registration and a Dock restart. Andrew's visual judgment in his own Dock remains useful; the Dock itself was not captured. This is a local ad-hoc build, not a notarized release.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-77.md): compare Fomawrite beside cmux at your usual Dock size.

## Cycle 78 — running Dock icon lifecycle

Planned scope: keep the approved light icon when Fomawrite is closed and show Andrew's first, cmux-matched dark concept while the macOS process is running; return to light only after a completed quit.

Changes: added a separate running-icon SVG/PNG resource generated by `./bin/make-app-icon`. macOS windows use the dark icon and AppKit temporarily overrides the Dock tile at launch. The existing guarded quit path remains intact; `aboutToQuit` clears the override and restores the light icon. Finder and the static bundle `.icns` remain light, and Linux's icon path is unchanged.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **111 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded; both signed bundles retain the unchanged light `.icns`. The running SVG matched the first approved dark concept at 128 px, and the refreshed Dev app launched. After both old processes exited, `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was replaced with the signed packaged app; its executable and light `.icns` match the package, its Finder-facing icon resolved to light, and it launched. See [Cycle 78 evidence](../research/cycle-78/README.md).

Known gaps: the running dark Dock tile and return to light after Quit still need a direct visual check. The desktop capture showed a remote Windows taskbar rather than the macOS Dock. This remains a local ad-hoc build, not a notarized release.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-78.md): inspect the Dock tile through launch, canceled Quit, and completed Quit.

## Cycle 79 — export and Visual Edit presentation

Planned scope: respond to Andrew's export-dialog and split-view screenshots with a calmer dialog hierarchy, stronger labels and buttons, and more readable Visual Edit text that better resembles the rendered document without changing canonical Markdown.

Changes: the export controls align to the top of the modal, with a concise subtitle, clearer section labels and a shorter Save action. The style gallery uses flat bordered selection cards rather than the native gray pill treatment; secondary actions are quieter. Visual Edit has an 18 px minimum body size independent of compact output styles, and supported bullet/numbered list lines display protected markers. Its bounded inline editing and source-only protections remain unchanged.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **112 tests, zero failures and zero skips**, including an export-hub open/readability regression and protected list-marker mapping checks. Both ordinary and Dev bundles were refreshed; the Dev bundle passed strict local signature verification and launched with a disposable Markdown sample. The running `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was not replaced or inspected. No private-screen capture was taken. See [Cycle 79 record](../research/cycle-79/README.md).

Known gaps: Andrew's visual judgment of the revised dialog and split view is still needed. Visual Edit remains limited to supported inline source spans; source-only blocks do not become WYSIWYG, and visual layout is an approximation of formatted output rather than page-exact. The full Cycle 69 acceptance matrix and notarized release remain open.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` for immediate review and `dist/Fomawrite.app` as the packaged ordinary build. The older `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` remains running. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-79.md): compare the Dev export dialog and Visual Edit with the screenshots.

## Cycle 80 — Source button leaves Visual Edit

Planned scope: fix Andrew's report that clicking Source in Visual Edit produced no visible change in Split view.

Changes: Source now turns off Visual Edit, selects the existing editor-only workspace mode, and focuses the Markdown source editor. It keeps the current document and cursor; the visual projection is not serialized or saved by switching modes.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **113 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. A focused regression invokes the document pane's Source button from Visual Edit and confirms editor-only mode, disabled visual mode and unchanged Markdown. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded; both bundles passed strict local signature verification. Andrew authorized closing Dev; it had already exited when checked, so the refreshed Dev bundle was installed and launched on a disposable sample. The running `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was not touched. See [Cycle 80 record](../research/cycle-80/README.md).

Known gaps: the refreshed button still needs Andrew's direct click check in his window. Visual Edit remains the conservative inline subset recorded in Cycle 69; source-only Markdown constructs are unchanged. This is an ad-hoc local build, not a notarized public release.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` for review and `dist/Fomawrite.app` as the packaged ordinary build. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-80.md): click Source from Visual Edit, then return to Split and Visual Edit.

## Cycle 81 — export gallery width and dialog fit

Planned scope: fix Andrew's screenshots showing the export style cards and heading clipped horizontally, with the scrollbar covering the card edges. Keep the dialog usable as its host window becomes narrower.

Changes: the style gallery now reserves a scrollbar gutter, uses a slim thumb, fixes its content to one column, and stacks the style-copy field and button so their combined implicit width cannot create horizontal scrolling. The export dialog fits within the host window, switches to a compact layout before the preview gets cramped, and scrolls its options independently; the wide gallery grows to 280 px. This dialog adapts with the parent window but is not a separate resizable window.

Tests and native verification: `./bin/build` passed and `./bin/test` passed **113 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The export UI regression verifies a wide gallery without horizontal overflow and checks that the compact dialog remains inside a 720 × 520 window. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` succeeded. The previously running Dev app exited normally before replacement, and the refreshed Dev bundle launched on a disposable sample. The running `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` was not replaced. See [Cycle 81 record](../research/cycle-81/README.md).

Known gaps: Andrew's direct visual check of the middle column at his display scale is still needed. The separate-window resizing idea has not been built; export preview remains continuous rather than page-exact. Full Cycle 69 acceptance and public signing remain open.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app` for review and `dist/Fomawrite.app` as the packaged ordinary build. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-81.md): open Export at normal and minimum app sizes and inspect the style cards and controls.

## Cycle 82 — export scrollbar and button clarity

Planned scope: address Andrew's screenshots of a scrollbar mark beside “Built-in styles” and secondary export controls that lacked an obvious button state.

Changes: both export scrollbars are placed at the right edge of their own clipped panes. Style cards and secondary actions now have a visible resting fill and border, a stronger accent outline on hover, and a clear selection outline. Split and Full in the export preview now switch between a read-only source/rendered split and the full rendered view.

Tests: `./bin/build` passed; `./bin/test` passed **113 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The export UI check verifies that Split reveals source and Full hides it, alongside the existing wide/narrow layout assertions. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` produced locally signed bundles; strict signature verification passed. See [Cycle 82 record](../research/cycle-82/README.md).

Native verification and known gaps: the old processes exited, allowing the Dev bundle and `/Applications/Fomawrite.app` to be refreshed. The installed executable matches the signed ordinary package, and Dev launched on a disposable sample. Andrew's direct visual review of scrollbar placement and control contrast is still open. The public signing and broader Cycle 69 acceptance work remain open.

Runnable artifacts: `/Applications/Fomawrite.app`, `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-82.md): inspect export scrollbars and button states at normal and narrow widths, including dark mode.

## Cycle 83 — resizable export layout

Planned scope: respond to Andrew's Cycle 82 screenshot by redesigning the whole Export dialog, not just individual buttons. Define reusable guidance for large task dialogs.

Changes: added the [dialog style guide](dialog-style-guide.md). Export now has a lower-right resize grip, draggable three-band splitters with minimum widths, a compact single-scroll layout, reserved scrollbar gutters, preview actions grouped with their content, and a fixed footer with equally sized Cancel and Save actions. The dialog stays bounded by its host window.

Tests: `./bin/build` passed; `./bin/test` passed **113 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The export UI test drags the outer grip and first divider, checks band minimums and equal footer sizes, and verifies compact and preview-mode behavior. Synthetic wide/compact light and wide dark renders were visually inspected. `./bin/package-mac` and `./bin/prepare-dev-app` passed with strict signature verification. See [Cycle 83 record](../research/cycle-83/README.md).

Native verification and known gaps: the refreshed Dev app launched on a disposable sample; Andrew's direct review at his display scale remains open. The installed Applications copy stays at Cycle 82 until review. The dialog is resizable within the app window, not a separate native window. Exact PDF page breaks remain in paginated preview rather than the continuous live view; broader Cycle 69 acceptance and public signing remain open.

Runnable artifacts: `dist/Fomawrite.app` and `dist/Fomawrite Dev.app`. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-83.md): drag the dialog edge and dividers, then inspect wide, compact and dark layouts.

## Cycle 84 — horizontal access in narrow Export

Planned scope: answer Andrew's follow-up that the compact Export layout hid the right bands. Let the dialog become thinner while retaining access to all three bands.

Changes: Export keeps the output, styles and live preview bands side by side at their useful minimum widths. Below the combined width, a persistent horizontal scrollbar moves between them; each band keeps its vertical scrolling. The title and action footer stay fixed. The resize grip allows 380 px, and the [dialog style guide](dialog-style-guide.md) now documents this behavior.

Tests and visual verification: `./bin/build` and `./bin/test` passed **113 tests, zero failures and zero skips**. The Export regression drags the horizontal scrollbar, checks that styles and preview remain present at 400 px, and scrolls the preview into view. Synthetic wide and narrow renders were inspected, including both ends of the scrollbar. `./bin/package-mac` produced a locally signed ordinary bundle. See [Cycle 84 evidence](../research/cycle-84/README.md).

Native verification and known gaps: the running Dev app must close normally before its QA bundle can be refreshed; the packaged ordinary bundle is ready. Andrew's direct display-scale review remains open. The dialog is still bounded by the host window; exact PDF page breaks are available through Paginated preview, not the live view. Public signing and broader Cycle 69 acceptance remain open.

Runnable artifact: `dist/Fomawrite.app` is current. The Dev bundle will be refreshed after its running process exits. [Optional exercise](../research/usability/cycle-84.md): shrink Export, scroll across all three bands, then expand it again.
